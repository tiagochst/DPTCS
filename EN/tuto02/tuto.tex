% Intro
% Which events will be staged in brazil? And, specifically, in which cities ?
% What does the press think about, Brazil, Brazil's infrastucture? 

In October 2007, Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the
sport's global governing body, chose Brazil as the host of 2014 world's cup.
And two years after, in October 2009, International Olympic Committee (IOC)
announced  that Rio de Janeiro,  will stage  the 2016  Olympic  and Paralympics
Games.  
% "happy  people" is not good,TO DO: think in another expression
Although its beautiful landscapes and hospitable people,
Brazil is seen by press as a doubtful country  regarding infrastructure and security.
