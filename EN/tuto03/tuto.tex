\begin{description}

\item[What is matrix?]
  {
    Matrix is a virtual computer-generated world created by machines to subdue
    the human population while they use human bodies as a source of energy. In
    fact, the matrix, which is our believed reality, is a prison while the real 
    world  is controlled and  is being  destroyed by  machines, which  are still
    trying to enslave all humans.
  }
  
\item[Who is Morpheus?]{
    Morpheus, one  of the last human survivals,  is the captain of  a human force's
    hovercraft, in which resides a resistance group. His job, as a captain, is to protect Zion City, the last human city
    in the real world, and to free humans from the matrix. He dedicated his life
    for searching 'The One', a man prophesied to end the war with machines and save human race.
  }
  
\item[What is an agent?]
  {
    An agent  is a computer program created by machines to
    maintain the matrix working properly, that means agents are supposed to eliminate any threats to the matrix.
  }


\item[How does Trinity make impossible things?]{ As the matrix in unreal, because it
    is a computer program, it does not respect real laws of physic, indeed, it has
    a simulation of these laws. Thus, as the resistance knows that it is not real,
    they can transpose these laws and have superhuman abilities in the virtual world.
  }

\item[Why Trinity got the telephone?]{
    The telephone is an exit to real world, that means it is the path to get out
    of matrix.

% 5 questions about the first 5 minutes of the movie


\subsection*{Recommendation}

Hi Mats!

% introduction why i think he will like it
In this Christmas, I watched an incredible science fiction movie, which name is Matrix. Everything in the movie is related to computer science, so I think you'll be pleased to watch it.

% the movie
%First of all, the main character is a hacker named ``Neo'', who is thought to be
%``The one'', that means he is someone different from others. But, why is he different?  That's a
%huge history.

Firstly, the movie's  idea is that we live in a  computer-generated world and we
think that we are  in year 1999, however the real world is  in year 2199 and the
scenario is not so good: the world is controlled by machines which are trying to
enslave the human  race to use us  as a source of energy.   Even though machines
control almost everything,  there is a survival city  named Zion, whose location
is near the center of the planet, and where the last free humans live.

In addition, this resistance city have some people that  were freed from the
matrix, and who  can renter again there. These people will  try to free
more humans and protect Zion. It would be a normal movie, but, as Matrix is
not real, these already freed humans can outbreak physics law when in matrix,
thus giving them the possibility to do incredible actions. 

Finally, if you watch this movie you will see amazing special effects; Moreover,
just to convince you that it is a great movie: it won  Oscars for film editing,
sound mixing, sound editing and visual effects. So, you must watch it.

See you,
Tiago
