\section{Analyzing Business Plans for telecom Projects}
\subsection{Telecom Project Business Model}

Nowadays, a great  number of different communication technologies have an important role in a Telecom projects. These technologies are mainly defined by two characteristics, which are data rate and mobility.
To achieve more data per time,in other words "high data rates", fixed technology, like optical  fiber, are used. That is possible because the environment of a optical fiber does not receive external perturbation. However, being a fixed technology it doesn't provides mobility to the user.
On the other hand, technologies which  privilege the mobility, like the GSM,  can't provides  a high data rate, because the environment it works receives external perturbation.

The figure \ref{fig:tel_tech} shows the characteristics of some technologies.

Having these different technologies to implement a telecom project, it is first needed to choose which one is the  most properly. For this, some simple questions should be made.

\begin{description}
\item[What is the business model?]  You should specify the organization from a
  high level of perspective (its purpose, offerings, strategies, infrastructure, etc.).
\item[Technology or service driven?] Which one will be offered? Should I offer both?
\item[Is  the ecosystem  ready?] Where  I'm  going to  offer my  product? Is  it
  possible to offer this product? Does the environment offer a necessary
    infrastructure?
\end{description}

Revenues had  a slightly increasing  if compared with  past years, on  the other
hand, the global traffic  has tripled in three years and it  is expected that it
will increase more in the next  years. So, today, revenues does not increases as
fast as the traffic.

Analyzing the  data, revenues  had a slightly  increasing if compared  with past
years, on the other  hand, the global traffic has tripled in  three years and it
is expected  that it will increase more  in the next years.  So, today, revenues
does not increases as fast as the traffic.Other interesting data: voice, although being a small part of the traffic
(20\% of total traffic), is the most profitable (80\% of revenues)

If a company will offer the infrastructure for telecommunication, some challenges
like finding the right mix of services and understand the market drivers will be
needed, because a company should offer only what costumer wants, and some times,
they want  both mobility  and high data  rates which  implies in a  difficult to
choose technologies and probably a high cost of implementation.

Although some companies are concerned about infrastructures (which have high costs), others are concerned
about offering a service using  an infrastructure created by other companies, so
they have low cost to offer its product.
For example,  Google, Facebook and Twitter, offer a service based on  a  software that  is connected  to
Internet which  uses   physical  links   implemented  by   telephone
companies. It is  remarkable that these companies don't  have infrastructure
costs, then, we can say that they are ``eating food of other''.



\subsection{Business Planning in Telecom Projects}
Business Planning in Telecom Projects have five phases:

\begin{description}
\item[Market] In this phase it is needed a demographic and economic study to 
  answer some questions like: What is the  country population and growth  rate? What is  population's capacity of
  spending money?  Which will probably be  the ARPU (Average  Revenue Per User)?
  And  how much  SIM cards  each  person would  have?\footnote{Depending in  the
    country some devices like GPS, PC and dual-chip mobile phones uses other SIM card, so a
    person would buy more than one SIM card} 
\begin{description}
\item[Marketing External factors] {\color{blue}1.  Country and market environment:} Demand,
  competitors, possibility  and level of  portability (change of  operator), How
  much does it cost  to construct  an infrastructure  in the  country (for  example to
  construct and maintain an antenna in Africa costs a lot, because of the cost of energy)etc. {\color{blue}2.  License and
  regulatory framework:} what is the best technology, what is the spectrum I'll
  be able  to work with, is it  acceptable for the service  offered? Which areas
  will be  covered? Will I cover only  overpopulated areas or I'll  offer a full
  mobility even if  I have a less crowded area? etc.  {\color{blue}3. Consumer behavior:} how
  much my  consumer will  consume? How the  most part  of the payments  are done
  (prepaid or postpaid)? etc.

\item[Marketing Internal factors] When my  network will be working? Which are my
  marketing strategies? How much I have to finance the structure?  etc. One 
  great idea is to compare market studies about one country, with another study
  done by competitors about a similar country.

\end{description}

\item[Revenues] In  this phase we  will estimated our  ARPU based in:  price per
  service,  price  per bundled  package,  price  trends  and forecasted  revenue
  mix.  After  we estimate  average  number of  user  based  in: traffic,  usage
  patterns, addressable market etc; So with {\color{red}ARPU} and an {\color{red}average number of users},
  multiplying both value will give us the {\color{red}service revenue.}

\item[Capital expenses]
\item[Operational expenses]
\item[Free cash flow]
