This dataset gives the electric power consumption of a household recorded
during year 2007 (with some missing days). The dataset contains 349 days of
recording. Each day is described by the global power consumption recorded at a
10 minutes sampling rate. 

The dataset file is organised as follows:

- the first row contains the headers describing the columns of the file
- each of the subsequent 349 rows corresponds to a day of power consumption
- the first column contains the date of recording in the format YYYY-MM-DD,
where YYYY is the year (2007 in this case), MM is the month and DD is the day
of the month.
- columns 2 to 145 contain an active power consumption value expressed in kilowatt 
(KW) ordered according to the time of the day, starting at 00:00. Each column
contains the average active power value during the 10 minutes time period that starts
at the time indicated in the header of the column. For instance, column 3 has
header "00:10" and gives therefore the average power from 00:10 to 00:20 (left
bound is included, right is not).
- columns 146, 147 and 148 are redundant with column 1 and are given to ease
processing of the recording dates. Column 146 contains the day of the month as
an integer (from 1 to 31), column 147 contains the month as an integer (from 1
to 12), and column 148 contains the weekday as an integer from 0 to 6, where
Sunday is 0.
