In article   t  nhg rpi edu  strider clotho acm rpi edu  Greg Moore  writes 
 
 	As Herny pointed out  you have to develop the thruster 
 Also  while much lighter  you still have to lift the mass of
 the thruster to orbit  and then the thruster lifts its own 
 weight into a higher orbit   And you take up room in the payload
 bay 
 

a yes   but the improvement in  boost orbit to the HST is Significant 
and  that means you can then carry EDO packs  and enough consumables
so the SHuttle mission can go on long enough to also fix the
array tilt motors   and god knows what else  is going to wear out
on the HST in the next   months
