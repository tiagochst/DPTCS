 Having read in the past about the fail safe mechanisms on spacecraft  I had
 assumed that the Command Loss Timer had that sort of function   However I
 always find disturbing the oxymoron of a  NO OP  command that does something 
 If the command changes the behavior or status of the spacecraft it is not
 a  NO OP  command 
 
 Of course this terminology comes from a Jet Propulsion Laboratory which has
 nothing to do with jet propulsion 
 

	I don t know where you got this idea from  JPL s history dates back to 
	to the     s when a Caltech professor named Von Karman conducted  
	experiments in rocket PROPULSION with a group of graduate students
	on the present site of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory    The Army started
	funding the laboratory and had jurisdiction untill the late     s when
	NASA took over  The early research conducted at the Laboratory
	led to many applications the first being Jet assisted takeoff rockets
	for aircraft   I think this should explain where JPL got it s name  I
	should know  I worked there for five wonderful years
