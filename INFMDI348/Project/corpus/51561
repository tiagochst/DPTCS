    Another alternative is the use of the sound input port 

  Can you really make due with the non existent dynamic range of an   bit
  converter  of probably dubious linearity and monotonicity  and perhaps
  AC coupled as well 

It clearly depends on the type of questions you are asking but in many
cases it will do fine  The critical information from the neuron is in
the firing frequency  maximum about     action potentials per
seconds   and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of the
signal shape  So the resolution of about       you get with an   bit
convertor is more then sufficient 

AC coupling does not have to be a problem either  since in many cases
you are not interested in the DC level  My pre amplifier is AC coupled
also  The critical point is the lowest frequency that will pass  If
the cutoff point is to high  the action potentials will be slightly
distorted  But even that normally does not matter since it is the
occurrence of the spike that is important  

However  I do want to know what exactly I can expect before I start
battling with the toolbox to get it going  As yet I have no clue were
to start looking for the technical specifications
