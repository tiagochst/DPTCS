 Better idea for use of NASA Shuttle Astronauts and Crew is have them be found
 lost in space after a accident with a worm hole or other space time glitch  
 
 Maybe age Jemison a few years  makeup and such  and have her as the only
 survivour of a failed shuttle mission that got lost   


Of course that asumes the mission was able to launch
