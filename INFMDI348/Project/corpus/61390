      Dandridge Cole and Isaac Asimov collaborated on a book titled 
    Habitable Planets for Man   I think  in        It should be available
   in most good libraries  or through inter library loan 
   

 This is the high school science version  the original Rand study by
 Stephen H Dole  Planets for Man  gives the harder numbers   graphs  
 such  but predates Michael Hart s    later  work on continuously 
 habitable zones 

Is this still in print or available  other than on loan    I remember
reading this many years ago and it s still the best thing I remember
in this vein
