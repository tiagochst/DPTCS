  an image of the moon has been caught in a weather satellite images of the earth 
 Near midsummer  you can see the relfection of the Sun in the ocean 
             Cool 
 Also during solar eclise you can see the shadow of the sun move
 across the clouds                                         
	I think you mean Moon 
		 Sorry  I had to
