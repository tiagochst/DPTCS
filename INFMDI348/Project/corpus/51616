    The Mac II is supposed to have a socket for the MC      PMMU chip  Could
 anyone let me know where that socket is on the motherboard  I have obtained
 a PMMU chip     Mhz  from a surplus store  and would like to install it onto
 my Mac II  circa        But I cannot see the socket myself when I tried to
 install it 

The original Mac II had an Apple MMU chip installed which performs a subset
of the       s functions   If you look underneath your front left floppy
bay you will find three chips  all approximately the same size   One will
be the        the next the        and the third  approximately the same
size  will be the Apple chip   It is easy to spot because it has a  hump 
in the middle of it 


Example 


                                    
                                     
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    

That and the Apple logo should make it easy to find
