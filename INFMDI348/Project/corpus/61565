   No   A  dragless  satellite does not magically have no drag  it burns fuel
   constantly to fight drag  maintaining the exact orbit it would have  if 
   there was no drag   
 
      Well  almost  It turns out that clever orbital mechanics can 
 engineer things so that resonant interactions with the higher order 
 harmonics of the Earth s gravitational field can pump energy into a 
 satellite  and keep it from experiencing drag effects for periods of 
 months to years  

A harmonic of the Earth s gravitational field   What IS a harmonic of the
Earth s gravitational field 

      My favorite example of this is the Soviet Russian heavy ELINT 
 satellites of the Cosmos      class  which are in      resonance  In 

     resonance with WHAT   It s not like there s any wavelength or frequency
to the Earth s gravitational field   Now  there  might be some interesting
interactions with the Moon s tidal effect  is that what you re talking about 
 
     This probably has little relevance to space stations  since the    
 degree orbits of the C     satellites are at     km  which is 
 unacceptably far into the inner van Allen belt for manned platforms  But 
 it s kind of interesting from the point of view of the physics of the 
 situation  

What are the physics of the situation   The only way I can see gravitational
effects being useful in adding energy to an object orbiting Earth is some
sort of interaction with the moon
