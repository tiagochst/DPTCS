scott prism gatech edu  Scott Holt  writes 
   Hate the sin but love the sinner    I ve heard that quite a bit recently  
  often in the context of discussions about Christianity and homosexuality   
  but the context really isn t that important  My question is whether that
  statement is consistent with Christianity  I would think not 

I m very grateful for scott s reflections on this oft quoted phrase   Could
someone please remind me of the Scriptural source for it    Rom       doesn t
count  kids    The manner in which this little piece of conventional wisdom is
applied has  in my experience  been uniformly hateful and destructive
