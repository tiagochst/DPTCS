   A while ago I posted a note asking for specs on the Quadra      and opinions on
   the Q    upgrade of a IIci vs  an accelerator card   So far no responsed that
   I ve noticed   Please let me know what you think of these possible upgrade
   paths   Cost  efficiency  pros cons  etc   Thanks 
  
    Complete Q    are best obtained from your dealer or some recent
  copy of MacWorld or MacUser   My foggy memory suggests that the most relevant
  comparison factors vis a vis a IIci are as follows 
  
       MHz      
       Mhz data path  don t recall this for sure  but it s slower
        than Q     style machines for sure  
    Ethertalk card on board
    Audio in out
      MB RAM on motherboard
      SIMM slots
      NuBus slots 
    More flexible build in video than the CI   Uses VRAM 
  
  In comparison  a IIci with an accelerator won t give you
    audio or ethernet  or the same video options 
    With a       accelerator  CPU performance can be comparable but I
    think it ends up costing more

  Actually  an accelerator such as the Daystar    MHz       is cheaper than
upgrading to a Q        MHz    The accelerator costs about       whereas
the upgrade costs        just quoted from my dealer    However the Q   
upgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to    
with   bit depth and up to     at    bit depth  with additional VRAM    It
also has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI  which
makes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive 

  If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you  you re
better off getting the Q    upgrade  otherwise save some money and get an
accelerator
