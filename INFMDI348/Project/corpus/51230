    More horrible deaths resulted from atheism than anything else 
 
  There are definitely quite a few horrible deaths as the result of
  both atheists AND theists        Perhaps  since I m a bit weak on
  history  somone here would like to give a list of wars caused led by
  theists     

This thread seems to be arguing the validity of a religious viewpoint
according to some utilitarian principle  i e  atheism religion is
wrong because it causes death   The underlying  moral  is that death
is  wrong    This is a rather arbitrary measure of validity 

Get some epistemology
