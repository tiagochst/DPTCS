      re  voyages of discovery    
     Could you give examples of privately funded ones 
 
Much of Cook s later exploration was privately funded  by Joseph Banks
among others  eg in Resolution   the earlier Endeavour    Colnett s voyage
to the Galapagos was substantially privately funded by the owners of
British whaling vessels   Chancellor and Willoughby were privately funded
by London merchant companies in their voyages to Muscovy   The list is
almost endless   Those doing the funding were about eighty percent
motivated by potential profit  ten percent by potential glory and ten
percent by the desire to advance the sum of human knowledge
