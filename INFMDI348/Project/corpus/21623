   But  haven t  all sinned  and come short of the glory
   of God   Romans       
   Those that cite this scripture to claim that even
   babes require baptism neglect that  sin is not imputed
   when there is no law   Romans       
  
   Therefore  until someone is capable of comprehending
   God s laws they are not accountable for living them 
   They are in the book of life and are not removed until
   they can make a conscious decision to disobey God

 If babies are not supposed to be baptised then why doesn t the Bible
 ever say so   It never comes right and says  Only people that know
 right from wrong or who are taught can be baptised  
         What Christ did say was  

          I solemly assure you  NO ONE can enter God s kingdom without
          being born of water and Spirit     Do not be surprised that I
          tell you you must ALL be begotten from above  

 Could this be because everyone is born with original sin 

 I presume you are quoting John        

    My King James Bible says  Except a man be born of water 
and of the Spirit  he cannot enter into the kingdom of God  
 John         Here  man      adult   
 However  this could be a quibble between translations  

    We can also analyze to whom the Lord is addressing 
 Marvel not that I said unto thee  Ye must be born again 
 John        Here Jesus is clearly directing his remarks
to Nicodemus    a ruler of the Jews  not a child  

    We can ask ourselves why the Lord would even 
introduce the concept of spiritual re birth through
baptism if newborn babies weren t free from sin

 Yup  in John      man  is not in the original   A better translation
is  no one can enter      as in NRSV   Of course in      Jesus is
addressing the person who came to him   There are other places in the
NT where he deals with children   They ve been mentioned in other
postings     clh
