 Sorry to split hairs  but I just read in  The making of the atomic
 bomb     that teflon was developed during world war     A sealant was
 needed for the tubing in which uranium hexafluoride passed as it was
 gradually enriched by difussion   UF  is very corrosive  and some very
 inert yet flexible material was needed for the seals 
 
To split a split hair  I believe that teflon   CF   monomer  was
 discovered  by accident when someone I don t remember
found what he thought was a liquid  or gas   had turned to a
solid   

It just happend to fit the bill for the above use   

I m crossposting to sci materials so perhaps someone in the know
might elaborate

   I know you believe you understand what it is that you            
  think I said   But I am not sure that you realize that         
  what I said is not what I meant
