Greetings and Salutations 

I would like to get in touch with people who
 a  consider themselves Christians  you define it   and
 b  are in the Martial Arts

Some topics for discussion 
	  your particular martial art
	  your view of the relationship between
		Christianity and your art
	  your view of the relationship between
		 your  Christianity and your art
	  why should a Christian participate in MA
	  why shouldn t a Christian participate in MA
	  Biblical views of MA  pro or con 

For example  I heard from one fellow 
	    I tried the Karate for Christ thing and it wasn t for me    
	  why or why not 

As an aside  I am involved  in  NO  official way  with an
organization called the Christian Black Belt Association and
I would also like to distribute info regarding upcoming events
to  those who are interested    No  you won t be put on any
 mailing list  nor will your name be  sold  

However  if you ARE intested in an email list  let me know 

I am interested in email replies ONLY as this is cross posted 
to groups I don t normally read   If anyone wants a summary
or  of course  on going discussion  then let me know 


Shalom 
Robert Switzer
