 Homosexual Christians have indeed  checked out  these verses   Some of
 them are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations 
 Others simply do not address the issues 
 
 You would seem to be more in need of a careful and Spirit led course
 in exegesis than most of the gay Christians I know   I suggest that
 you stop  proof texting  about things you know nothing about 

Let me say that the life  death  and resurrection of Jesus Christ is
central to Christianity  If you personally believe that Jesus Christ
died for you  you are a part of the Christian body of believers 

We are all still human  We don t know it all  but homosexual or heterosexual 
we all strive to follow Jesus   The world is dying and needs to hear about
Jesus Christ 

Are you working together with other Christians to spread the Gospel
