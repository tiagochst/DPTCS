tzs stein  u washington edu  Tim Smith  writes 

   ATTENTION  Mac Quadra owners  Many storage industry experts have
   concluded that Mac Quadras suffer from timing irregularities deviating
   from the standard SCSI specification  This results in silent corruption
   of data when used with some devices  including ultra modern devices 
   Although I will not name the devices  since it is not their fault  an
   example would be a Sony     inch MO  without the special  Mac compatible 
   firmware installed  One solution  sometimes  is to disable  blind writes 

 This doesn t sound right to me   Don t Quadras use the   C     If so  the
 Mac has nothing to do with the SCSI timing   That s all handled by the
 chip   About the only the timing could be wrong is if Apple programs the
 clock registers wrong on the      That  however  should only really hurt
 synchronous transfer  which is not used by the Mac SCSI Manager 

 Furthermore  disabling blind writes should be meaningless on a Quadra 
 On Macs that used the       which is a much lower level SCSI chip  the
 Mac was responsible for the handshake of each byte transferred   Blind
 mode affected how the Mac handled that handshake   On the       the
 handshake is entirely handled by the chip 

The docs say that it s a SCSI Manager bug  if this changes things at all   
   
    Jim Jagielski                   And he s gonna stiff me  So I say 
    jim jagubox gsfc nasa gov        Hey  Lama  How about something 
    NASA GSFC  Code                 you know  for the effort
