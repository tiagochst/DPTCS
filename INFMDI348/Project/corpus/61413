    sci space readers can skip the first paragraph 

  Yesterday  in response to Henry Spencer s question about the 
temperature of a blackbody in interstellar space  I said  Dust grains
acts as blackbodies  and they re at        K    Well  I was dead
wrong   Our local interstellar dust expert  Bruce Draine  has
informed me that dust grains  aren t  good radiators in the far IR 
which is why they are so warm  actually  the ambient radiation field
from distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only   or   Kelvin 
Sorry  Henry  and anyone else I misled   Obviously  time for me to
take another ISM class    

  In other news  Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute gave
a talk on the Pluto Charon binary system yesterday   He gave a brief
overview of the currently accepted system parameters  volume ratio of
about      mass ratio about      or so  plus lots more     and then
gave his thoughts on the formation of Pluto Charon   His idea is 
that there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer
solar system  with masses distributed as a power law of some kind 
over time  the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies   Most got
scattered out of the solar system by close encounters with Jupiter
and Saturn  but many accreted into the gas giants  especially
Uranus and Neptune   A large planetesimal was captured by Neptune  
we call it Triton  captured how   Perhaps by a collision with a smaller 
already existing Neptunian moon  perhaps by a very close passage through
Neptune s atmosphere   mondo aerobraking   

  He notes that the two recently discovered  Kuiper Belt  objects 
     QB  and      FW  plus Chiron and Pholus  are all about the same 
mass  and he identifies this group as one accretion down from the
larger bodies of Triton and Pluto Charon   Pluto Charon  he thinks 
formed when an impacting body hit proto Pluto  knocking some material
into a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon  similar to
ideas about the formation of Earth s moon   There is good evidence
from spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different
 Pluto has methane frost  Charon doesn t   which can be used as evidence
for the impact theory 

  He believes that there may be around      Pluto to Chiron sized objects
remaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune s 
orbit  beyond    AU or so        QB  and      FW are the first members
of this population to be found  in his model   Note that such bodies
will be very dark  since if their surfaces are covered with methane 
frost  it will have photolyzed into very dark  long chain hydrocarbons
by now   The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo  around      I think 
is that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate 
and when the atmosphere freezes out again  thirty years later  it forms
bright  new frost   So any bodies much farther away than    AU are going
to be very hard to see 

  I hope I haven t made any errors in the transcription  if you see
a howling mistake  it s undoubtedly mine  not his 

  By the way  he s one of the top guns behind the Pluto Fast Flyby
mission  I think   and said that the current plans are to use a
Titan   to send the probe on  just about a rectilinear trajectory 
to Pluto  we were speaking loosely at the time       He d like
to use a Proton  which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs
MUCH less   His figures       Million for   Titan   launches  there
will be two separate probes  launched separately   or      Million
for   Proton launches   He told a story about how the Soviets originally
offered to sell Proton launches for     Million each  but were forced
to increase their prices in the US in order to be allowed in the
marketplace 

  I m just telling you what he said
