 If re boosting the HST by carrying it with a shuttle would not damage it 
 then why couldn t HST be brought back to earth and the repair job done
 here 

I m not sure if this is a big issue  but it seems to me like it
might be    up till now  all   g forces applied to the mirror and
its mounting  and nearly all   g forces  have been applied along the
telescope s optical axis  and against the mirror s base   Reentry
would apply forces along roughly the same axis  but tending to pull
the mirror away from the mount  and the landing would apply on edge
forces to both the mirror and mount   It could be that one or both
of these would not survive
