                     MISSION DIRECTOR STATUS REPORT
                               POST LAUNCH
                           April              

SPACECRAFT

    On April    and     delta Differenced One way Range  DOR  passes were
performed over DSS        Goldstone Madrid    meter antennas  and DSS      
 Goldstone Canberra    meter antennas   respectively   Initial results 
indicate the delta DOR pass on April    was unsuccessful due to ground
station hardware problems but the one on April    was successfully performed 

    On April     a cruise science Memory Readout  MRO  was performed for the
Magnetometer  MAG  instrument   Analysis indicates the data was received
properly 

    On April     the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the
spacecraft stored sequence   These relays were commanded closed by the CDS
 Command Data Subsystem  prior to launch and were again commanded closed to
preclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays wiring being a
source of internal electrostatic charge  IESD  

    On April     cruise science Memory Readouts  MRO  were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer  EUV   Dust Detector  DDS   and Magnetometer
 MAG  instruments   Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received
properly 

    During the period from April    to April     a navigation cycle was
performed   This navigation cycle provided near continuous acquisition of
two way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the
spacecraft over DSS     DSS     and DSS    

    On April     real time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay
Antenna  RRA  in preparation for the mini sequence slew test on April    
The RRA was slewed from approximately     degrees from stow to approximately
     degrees   Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about   
degrees which was well within the predicted range   The RRA was commanded back
to approximately      degrees from stow   Preliminary analysis indicated the
antenna reached about      degrees also well within the predicted range   The
RRA motor temperature was at   degree C at the start of the activity and had
increased to     degrees C at its completion 

     After verifying proper RRA slewing  the RRA slew test mini sequence was
uplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April      Upon successful uplink 
a Delayed Action Command  DAC  was sent which will reposition the stator on
May   to its initial pre test position   Also  a DAC was sent to turn the
Two Way Noncoherent  TWNC  on April    prior to the start of the RRA slew test
mini sequence 

    On April     a NO OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to
    hours  its planned value during this mission phase 

    On April     the RRA slew test executed nominally   The spacecraft under
stored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about    degrees
from stow and going to    degrees  back to    degrees  then to    degrees 
back to    degrees  then to    degrees and then back to    degrees   All of
the slews were well within the predicted range   The RRA motor temperature was
at     degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to    
degrees C at its completion   After completion of the RRA slews  real time
commands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre test configuration 

    The AC DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change
 greater than    DN  throughout this period   The AC measurement reads    DN
     volts    The DC measurement reads     DN       volts    These
measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC DC special
anomaly team 

    The Spacecraft status as of April           is as follows 

       a   System Power Margin       watts
       b   Spin Configuration   Dual Spin
       c   Spin Rate Sensor       rpm Star Scanner

GDS  Ground Data Systems  

    The first Galileo GDS test of the MGDS V     Command System  CMD  took
place April          with DSS     Madrid    meter antenna    The test went
well and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN
 Deep Space Network  Group   Command Processor Assembly  CPA    The test was
successful and the next test for V     CMD is scheduled for May         with
DSS     Goldstone    meter antenna  

    The April System Engineers Monthly Report SEMR  Ground System Development
Office  GSDO  MMR was conducted Thursday  April       A review of current
Project and Institutional  DSN and MOSO  system status was conducted   On going
cruise development plus the GSDO Phase   and   delivery schedules  past months
accomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed   No significant
schedule changes or significant problems were reported 


TRAJECTORY

     As of noon Thursday  April           the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory
status was as follows 

	Distance from Earth                     km       AU 
	Distance from Sun                       km       AU 
	Heliocentric Speed                 km per hour

SPECIAL TOPIC

    As of April           a total of       real time commands have been
transmitted to Galileo since Launch   Of these         were initiated in the
sequence design process and      initiated in the real time command process 
In the past week     real time commands were transmitted     were initiated
in the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command
process   Major command activities included commands to perform the initial
RRA slew test  uplink the RRA slew test mini sequence  DACs to reposition the
stator and turn the TWNC on  reset the command loss timer  and execute the
RRA slew test
