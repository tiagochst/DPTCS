   people in primitive tribes out in the middle of nowhere as they look up
   and see a can of Budweiser flying across the sky      D

  Seen that movie already  Or one just like it 
  Come to think of it  they might send someone on
  a quest to get rid of the dang thing   

  In one of his lesser known books  I can t
  remember which one right now   the protagonists are in a balloon gondola 
  travelling over Africa on their way around the world in the balloon   

  That s  Five Weeks In A Balloon    And if anyone can tell me where to
get it  I sure would like a reply   I ve been looking for that book for
TEN YEAR   and never found it    Note that I am  not  looking for a     
collector s item  I m hoping that  someone  has published it in modern
times  either in paperback or hardcover   I m willing to spend     or
so to get a copy
