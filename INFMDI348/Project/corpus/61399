    people in primitive tribes out in the middle of nowhere as they look up

That has sort of happened for real  Back in the      s travellers
in the Sudan would find strange cigar shaped designs on native huts 
When asked the locals would say it was a picture of the great omen
that appeared in the sky  This was LZ    a zepplin flying from Bulgaria
to German East Africa with supplies in       and back since it was fooled
by the British secret service
