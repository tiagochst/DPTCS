I like it a lot  It is worth the additional expense  The only problem I
found is with MS Word     a   If you have a table the is longer than
a page and the cells have a visible border  the last  bottom of page 
line on the first page will be missing  It makes no difference how
the table is formatted  The worst is that it doesn t show up in word s
page view or page preview
