   With a little luck  I could own a C    sometime in the near future  and
   so I was just wondering if someone could clear these two questions up for me 
   
       What speed SIMMS does the C    need want    I know that it needs   ns
   VRAM   not sure for the main RAM  
   
  
    ns    pin simms 
  
       I ve heard two conflicting stories about the total expandibility of the
   C    s RAM       and     megs   Which is true    Perhaps another phrasing
   would be better   does the   meg version come with all   megs on the logic
   board  or   megs   a   meg SIMM  
   
    configs   mb    mb  In each case the memory is soldered on the board
  leaving the   simm sockets open     mb is the total addressable memory for a
      

According to the  seen several times  postings from Dale Adams of Apple
Computer  both the     and the     require   ns SIMMS   NOT    ns   Only
the Centris     requires    ns SIMMs
