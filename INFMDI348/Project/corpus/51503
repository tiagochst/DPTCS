    Basically  the Mac Pluses are constantly rebooting themselves  as if  
the
    reboot button were being pushed   Sometimes the Mac is able to fully  
boot
    and display the desktop  but it is only a matter of time before it  
reboots
    again   At times  the frequency is as high as several times a minute  
    
     I wonder if your Mac has those little  RESET   INTERUPT  switches
     installed   They are plastic devices that push on the switches which
     are inside the mac   Or mabey those switches are bad and need
     replacing 

This problem is usually a low    Vdc from the power supply  there is an  
adjustment for this on the supply  If the voltage is still unstable or low  
then the culprit is probably a bad rectifier at CR
