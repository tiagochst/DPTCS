Hi    what alternatives to the Express modem do Duo owners have  if
they want to go at least      baud  

Every place in town says they are back ordered  and part of the reason
I want a laptop mac is so I can use it as a remote terminal from
wherever I am  but I really would hate to have to wait   months to get
a modem in or have to settle with      baud 

Thank you
