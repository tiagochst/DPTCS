I would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for Humans 
I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere evolve given a range
of physical aspects of the planet   The question is what physical aspects
simply disallow earth like conditions 

eg Temperature range of    K to    K  where temp is purely dependant on dist
     from the sun and the suns temperature   
   Atmospheric presure     I know nothing of human tolerance
   Planetary Mass     again gravity at surface is important  how much
     can human bodies take day after day   Also how does the mass effect
     atmosphere   I thinking of planets between    and   times mass of the
     earth   I suppose density should be important as well 

Climate etc does not concern me  nor does axial tilt etc etc   Just the above
three factors and how they relate to one another
