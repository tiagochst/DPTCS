 Since we are on the subject of chip power consumption 

 I heard  from a very reliable source  that the DEC Alpha chip uses
     the power that Intel s Pentium chip does  and it still whips
 the Pentium s butt   Makes you wonder why Intel ever made
 a chip to begin with 

 Wouldn t you like a PowerBook Alpha running about     MIPS   Cool idea  


	Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt   Sorry    wrong  It would be an
extremely hot idea   at least with the current Alphas  The available
Alphas run up to     MHz  But they produce quite a bit of heat  In
fact so much that they need special mounting with extra large heat
sinks 
	Also Apple looks pretty commited to the PowerPC route instead
of a deal with DEC
