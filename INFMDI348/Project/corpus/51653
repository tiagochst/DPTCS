Hi there 


I have a question regarding Quadras VRAM  I have tried to find info on this
but I could not get precise answers 

On one hand  we have a Quadra     with a     monitor  which is capable of
   bit color  How much VRAM does it have 
On the other hand  we have a Quadra     with a     monitor  which is capable
of   bit color only  so it must have     Ko of VRAM 

I would like to take VRAM SIMMs for the     and put them in the     so that
both machines have    bit color capability 
Is it possible  and if yes  how many VRAM SIMMs should I take from the     
From the documentation I have  the Quadra     must get   Mo VRAM to have
   bit color  is that correct 

Bonus question  where do VRAM SIMMs hide  From the     documentation  they
seem to be  behind  the power supply  Do I really have to take off the power
supply to access the VRAM SIMMs 


Thanks for your help
