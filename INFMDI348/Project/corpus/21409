Eugene Bigelow writes 

 Doesn t the Bible say that God is a fair god  sic    If this is true 
how can  this possibly be fair to the infants 

What do you mean fair   God is just  giving to everyone what they
deserve  As all infants are in sin from the time of conception  cf
Romans       Psalm       they cannot possibly merit heaven  and as
purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins  it
is impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven   Hence  the unbaptized
infants are cut off from the God against whom they  with the whole of
the human race except Mary  have sinned   Which is why Jesus said 
 Truly  truly I say to you  no one can enter the Kingdom of God unless
he is born of water and Spirit  which is the true meaning of born again
 John        Thus  as infants are in sin  it is very fair for them to be
cut off from God and exlcuded from heaven 

As St  Augustine said   I did not invent original sin  which the
Catholic faith holds from ancient time  but you  who deny it  without a
doubt are a follower of a new heresy     De nuptiis  lib     c
