In article  May                       athos rutgers edu  revdak netcom com  D  Andrew Kille  writes 
 Just an observation  although the bodily assumption has no basis in
 the Bible  Carl Jung declared it to be one of the most important pronouncements
 of the church in recent years  in that it implied the inclusion of the 
 feminine into the Godhead 

   Jung may have said that  but he was in no way speaking for the
Catholic Church   The dogma of the Assumption in no way means Mary is
considered to be God or part of  the Godhead    Therefore it implies no
such thing about the feminine in general 

   Also Jung s statement makes it sound as though the dogma was
announced  out of the blue    This also is incorrect  as dogma is only
the formulation of what has always been part of Tradition   This dogma
has always been believed  but was not formally defined until the
Assumption was declared as an  ex cathedra  statement
