    	As Herny pointed out  you have to develop the thruster 
    Also  while much lighter  you still have to lift the mass of
    the thruster to orbit  and then the thruster lifts its own 
    weight into a higher orbit   And you take up room in the payload
   bay 
   
   
   a yes   but the improvement in  boost orbit to the HST is Significant 
 
 I do not understand what you are saying here   What is improved  what 
 is Significant  and what does this have to do with carrying more 
 equipment on a servicing mission   Also  as implied by other posters  why 
 do you need to boost the orbit on this mission anyway   Maybe you have 
 something here  but could you please clarify it for us on the net  
 

RIght now the HST sevicing mission is listed as    days   before
it was listed as   days   they just kicked up the number of spacewalks
to     after simulations indicated  that it was not do able in     

After all the space walking   they are going to  re boost the HST s
orbit   I think right now  it s sitting  at     miles up 
they would like        I don t know the exact orbit numbers 
I know when HST was first flown  it was placed in the Highest
possible Shuttle orbit  

Now the shuttle can cary a thing called the EDO pallet  or extended
duration orbiter pallet   It s mostly  LOX LH for the fuel cells
and RCS gear   plus more O   and canisters for the life support
re breathers   maybe more nitrogen too 

THe limit on space walking is a function of suit supplies  MASS 
and Orbiter Duration    

In order to perform the re boost of the HST  the OMS engines
will be fired for a long period   Now the shuttle is a heavy
thing   THe HST isn t light either   THe amount of OMS fuel
needed to fly both up is substantial    a small booster
carried up and used to boost HST on it s own will weigh significantly
less then the OMS fuel required to Boost  both HST and SHUttle 
for a given orbital change   

From what i understand   the mass margins on the HST missions are
tight enough they can t even carry extra Suits or MMU s 

Now if they used a small tug   I would bet   just a wild guess 
that the savings on amss margin  would allow carrying the
EDO pallet   extra suits   more consumables   parts for the
flaky FGS sensor   parts for the balky solar  electronics 

and still enough for a double magnum of champagne 

or the HST could even get placed into  some sort of medium orbit 
The reason they want a high orbit  is less antenna pointing 
and longer drag life 

   and  that means you can then carry EDO packs  and enough consumables
   so the SHuttle mission can go on long enough to also fix the
   array tilt motors   and god knows what else  is going to wear out
 
 From what I ve heard  the motors are fine   it is one of the two 
 sets of electronics that control the motors that needs a fix   The 
 motors and electronics are separate pieces of hardware   I expect 
 to be corrected if I m wrong on this  
 

a
Whatever it is   the problem in the tilt array is a big constraint
on HST ops
