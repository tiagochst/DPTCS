In article      Apr                rpslmc edu  rek siss    Robert Kaye  writes 
 
 Just a few contributions from the space program to  regular  society 
 
   	Calculators
   	Teflon  So your eggs don t stick in the pan 
   	Pacemakers  Kept my grandfather alive from      until      

I don t think touting contributions is a good idea   World War II produced
many many beneficial spinoffs   Eg  Radar  jet aeroplanes  rocket technology 
I don t think anyone would argue that World War II was  in and of itself 
a good thing 

If you want people to back the space program it must be a good thing in
and of itself 
  
Paul
