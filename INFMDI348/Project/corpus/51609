  Finally got my computer fixed and I d like to sum up 
  
  About hard drive companies  the original     meg drive that was bad  bad
  sector or something  was an IBM   The new one is a Quantum   Is the LCIII
  supposed to be shipped with IBMs   Is there a quality difference  
  Apparently    
  
  Second  about hard drive position   I ve put the LCIII on its side and
  the new     HD has had no problems at all   I ve even switched back and
  forth between horizontal and vertical and there are no problems   As far
  as I m concerned I don t believe HD position is important for drives up
  to     meg  in any computer   Don t know about CD ROM  though

	Its not a good idea to have a horizontally formatted hard disk in a  
vertical position   If the drive is formatted in a horizontal position  it can  
not completely compensate for the gravitational pull in a vertical position    
I m not saying that your hard disk will fail tomorrow or   months from now  but  
why take that chance   If you want more detailed info on the problem  please  
mail me at      sunnyt dna bchs uh edu
