 I have a question about WINBENCH  pc labs thing        
 
 I have a        and a Ahead B     k  card and got these results 
 
 windows vga driver        million
 ahead B               driver           winmarks
 windows svga              driver        million winmarks   
 
 I was thinking about upgrading to a diamond   x card   I read it had about
   million winmark  
 
 obviously this is MUCH MUCH greater    but is this in     color mode or what 
 is this a good card   street price is about        

On my    dx   Mhz  Mb RAM
Winbench
