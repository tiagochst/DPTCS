I wrote that I thought that   Peter      meant   no prophecy of
Scripture  or  as one reader suggests  no written prophecy  is
merely the private opinion of the writer  

Tony Zamora replies  Sat   May       that this in turn implies that
it is not subject to the private interpretation of the reader
either  I am not sure that I understand this 
     In one sense  no statement by another is subject to my private
interpretation  If reliable historians tell me that the Athenians
lost the Pelopennesian War  I cannot simply interpret this away
because I wanted the Athenians to win  Facts are facts and do not go
away because I want them to be otherwise 
     In another sense  every statement is subject to private
interpretation  in that I have to depend on my brains and
expereience to decide what it means  and whether it is sufficiently
well attested to merit my assent  Even if the statement occurs in an
inspired writing  I still have to decide  using my own best
judgement  whether it is in fact inspired  This is not arrogance   
it is just an inescapable fact 

 Yours 
 James Kiefer
