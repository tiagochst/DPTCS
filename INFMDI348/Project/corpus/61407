                     MARS OBSERVER STATUS REPORT
                           April         
                                  PM PDT

Flight Sequence C  is active as of       AM  Tuesday  April      With
activities beginning at shortly before      AM yesterday  C  commanded
the spacecraft to execute a series of slews and rolls to provide the MAG
 Magnetometer  Team data points in varying spacecraft attitudes and
orientations for the purpose of better characterizing the
spacecraft generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument 

The spacecraft was commanded back to Sun Star Init state at      AM to
re establish Inertial Reference   Transition back to Array Normal Spin
began at       AM  after which the sequence powered on the on board
transmitter at       AM   Telemetry reacquisition occurred at
approximately       AM at the   KBS Science and Engineering downlink
data rate on the High Gain Antenna   Subsystem engineers report that all
systems appear to be nominal   The command to terminate using the Low
Gain Antenna for uplink was sent at       PM   Uplink and Downlink are
currently via the HGA 

MAG Calibration data has been recorded on Digital Tape Recorders   and   
Playback of DTR   is scheduled to take place tomorrow morning between
     AM and       PM   Playback of DTR   is scheduled to take place
tomorrow evening beginning at       PM and ending at      AM on Friday 
DTR playback will be performed via the High Gain Antenna at        bits
per second   Upon verification of successful DTR playbacks  downlink will
be maintained at the  K S   E rate 

The MAG Cal activity timeline ends at shortly before      AM on Friday
morning
