Hi all 
Thanks to you all who have responded
to my request for info on various kinds of fax modem 
I d like to ask a few more questions 
    What are the advantages of buying a global village
Teleport Gold over other cheaper brands like Supra  Zoom etc 
    I heard that both Supra and Zoom use the same software 
Why are there so many complaints about the incompatibility problems
of Supra   What kind of incompatibility is it 
    If I decided to buy the Teleport Gold  is there any
possibility to add a voice option in the near future 
    Has anyone heard of a possible voice option that Supra will offer
this coming summer 
    A person did mention a new AT T modem   Is it
getting good reviews from various Mac Magazines 
    If I want the best  fastest  most economically sound and
possible voice option  what fax modem should I buy 

Sorry for posting so many questions  but I think they re necessary 
I promise to repost any answers if they re not already posted by a responder 

Thanks so much in advance 

Regards 

Thian
