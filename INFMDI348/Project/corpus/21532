Edgar Pearlstein asks  Fri   May       whether the Supreme Court  or
any other government authority  has attempted a legal definition of
religion 

The Universal Military Training and Service Act of      exempted
from the draft those whose  religious training and belief  was
opposed to participation in war in any form  It defined  R T   B  as
 an individual s belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving
duties superior to those arising from any human relation  but  not
including  essentially political  sociological  or philosophical
views or a merely personal moral code  

In the      case of UNITED STATES V  SEEGER  the Supreme Court
broadened the definition so as not to restrict it to explicit
theists  Justice Tom Clark  delivering the Court s opinion  said 

   We have concluded that Congress  in using the expression  Supreme
   Being  rather than the designation  God        the test of belief
    in a relation to a Superme Being  is whether a given belief that
   is sincere and meaningful occupies a place in the life of its
   possessor parallel to that filled by the orthodox belief in God
   of one who clearly qualifies for the exemption  Where such
   beliefs have parallel positions in the lives of their respective
   holders we cannot say that one is  in a relation to a Supreme
   Being  and the other is not     

My immediate reference is THE FIRST FREEDOM  by Nat Hentoff 
 Delacorte       Dell
