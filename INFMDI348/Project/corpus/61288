     What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away 
  
   Given the enormous  power   i was just wondering   what if they are
   quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by 
  
   Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges    
  
      David gives good explaination of the deductions from the isotropic 
 edged  distribution  to whit  they are either part of the Universe or
part of the Oort cloud 

Why couldn t they be Earth centred  with the edge occuring at the edge
of the gravisphere  I know there isn t any mechanism for them  but there
isn t a mechanism for the others either
