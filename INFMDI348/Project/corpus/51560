I ve just completed a successful upgrade of a an SI to      mhz  I m waiting
on delivery of a    mhz clock for a final speed trial  Definitely needed the
heatsink  The CPU was quite hot to the touch at higher speeds until I glued
on a    cent Radio Shack sink  

I made a call for reports of failures last week  No reports have arrived
here  Locally  in Seattle there is a reported CPU damage due to the user
slipping with the iron and putting a gash into the board    not exactly
a problem due to the CPU running too fast 

I think it would be nice to have a poll to report top speeds and system
configurations including PDS and Nubus cards which were used  I d be happy
to coordinate and report results
