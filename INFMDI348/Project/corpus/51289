    Actually  cannibalism is quite widespread   My favorite examples are sand
    sharks and mackerel sharks   The fetuses begin cannibalizing each other  and
    the one that is eventually born enters the sea with a full stomache   Would
    you like some more gruesome examples 
  Fair enough   I m pretty well aware of the examples used   and mine were very
  rapidly and thoughtlessly pulled out of thin air  but the point I m making is
  that our non cannibalism doesn t imply any  value  over other animals 
 Did something happen while I wasn t looking   When did  Homo sapiens  become
 non cannibalistic 

Including ritualized cannibalism where the act itself becomes sacred
