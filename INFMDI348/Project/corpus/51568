Hi 

I m in the market for an internal color video adaptor for my PB       I
was wondering if anyone has used the PowerVision adaptor made by
Mirror   If so  can you tell me how feel about the speed and
compatability of it   I might also be interested in other boards by
Envisio etc   so if you have such a board please e mail your opinion of
it   Thanks in advance 

John
