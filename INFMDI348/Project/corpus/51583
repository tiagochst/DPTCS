 I am looking for one of those color LCD screens you
 place on an overhead projector and control the presentation
 with a Mac 

 Can you recommend me a particular brand 
 What price are we talking about 

For a good display  you  must  get an active matrix panel and a  very 
bright overhead projector designed to be used with an LCD panel  i e 
stage must not get too hot   I tried out a Proxima Ovation unit and liked
it  but I needed a brighter projector  I used it with a  M       It is
also too expensive for what you get  IMHO  Prices of active matrix panels
are rumoured to drop substantially sometime this year  something to do
with tarrifs being lifted I think   

In Canadian dollars  the Proxima Ovation models ranged in price from about
      to       and a good overhead projector about       to        For
that kind of money  you can get a brighter image from a three beam
projector  but sacrifice portability 

Oh yes  proper room lighting is extremely important  especially if you
want your audience to have enough light to read handouts and not have that
light wash out your display at the front of the room  Tricky to get right
