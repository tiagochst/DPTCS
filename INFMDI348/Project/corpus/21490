In article  May                       geneva rutgers edu  gideon otago ac nz  Gideon King  writes 
 When the Protestant reformers opposed and subsequently separated from the  
 Church of Rome  the battle cry of the new protesting religion was  The  
 Bible  the whole Bible  and nothing but the Bible   Underlying that cry  
 was a theory that if people could read the Bible for themselves in their  
 native tongue they would discover the truth about God and His purpose   
 They would shed their old errors and be united by a common faith 

   This idea  that the Reformers somehow were the first to bring the
Bible to the people in their own language  is a myth   Many vernacular
translations of the Bible existed long before the Reformation   The
Vulgate Bible  which is still the official version of the Bible for the
Catholic Church  was itself a translation in the common  i e  vulgar   
vulgate  tongue of its day  Latin  and had existed for about a millenium
before the Reformation 

   It might also be noted that the printing press was not even invented
until the same century as that in which the Reformation occurred
