I commend everybody to look at the FTP site  ftp cicb fr 
   Ethernet address                
in the directory  pub Images ASTRO 
there are lots of images  all of kinds in astronomy subject 
especially in GIF format and a NEW   directory of some JPL animations

For your comfort  README files in all subdirectories give size and
description of each image  and a   days  newer images  list is in READMENEW

Note  you can connect it as  anonymous  or  ftp  user  then the quota
      for each is   users connected in the same time 
      So  if the server responds you  connection refused   be patient  

 nd note  this site is reachable by Gopher at  roland cicb fr 
             Ethernet address                 
          in  Divers serveurs Ftp Le serveur ftp du CRI CICB Images ASTRO
