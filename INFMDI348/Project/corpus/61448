  I am taking a course entitled  Exploring Science Using Internet  
  For our final project  we are to find a compendium of Internet resources 
  dealing with a science related topic  I chose Astronomy  Anyway  I was 
  wondering if anyone out there knew of any interesting resources on Internet
  that provide information on Astronomy  space  NASA  or anything like that 

Do you know of the world wide web   This is a global hypertext  well  
hypermedia  network running on the internet   One of the nice things
about it is that is understands and incorporates virtually all of the
other systems being used  like WAIS  Gopher  FTP  Archie  etc   It
is usually quite easy to add existing resources to the web 

If you d like to explore  I d suggest getting the XMosaic program 
written at the NCSA   It s an X windows web browser  and is pretty
slick   It can understand and cope with more than text  gif  jpeg  mpeg 
audio  etc   There are other browsers  including a text mode browser
for people stuck on a text terminal  but I m most familliar with mosaic 

Under the page  The World Wide Web Virtual Library  Subject Catalogue 
 this is available under the Documents menu in mosaic  or by any
browser via the URL 
http   info cern ch hypertext DataSources bySubject Overview html  
there is a subject  Space Science    Currently this points to a
page under construction  with only the NASA JPL FTP archive   I ve
volunteered to take over this page  and in fact I have a replacement
with all sorts of information pointers  mostly gleaned from the
sci space FAQ    As soon as the overworked  Subject Catalogue  
maintainer switches the  Space Science  pointer  it ll be visible 

I ll post a short note when this happens
