In the course of discussing the Sabbath with some folks  
I came across something that was completely new to me  
and I thought I d offer it for comment 

To keep this as brief as possible  let me state my 
observation as a declarative statement  and then whoever 
wants to can comment on it   Basically  what I think 
I ve observed is that the phrase  the Ten Commandments   
as used by Moses  is not a reference to Ex           but 
rather a reference to ten distinct discourses from Ex  
     through Ex          That is  the phrase  the Ten 
Commandments  should more accurately be translated  the 
Ten Discourses   of which the passage we call the  Ten 
Commandments  is really only the first 

I m not completely convinced that the above is true  but 
for purposes of discussion  let me argue it as though I 
was sure 

Arguments supporting the above idea 

    There aren t really ten commandments in Ex            
In order to get    commandments  you have to get two of 
them out of verses      and the verses themselves do not 
support such a division because they are all about not 
worshipping other gods   That is  verse   commands to 
have no other gods  and verse   commands to not worship 
the idols mentioned in verse     You can t violate 
verses     without violating verse    indicating that 
the whole passage is one command  and leaving us with 
only Nine  Commandments    I could go on at length about 
this  but for now I ll just stop with this summary 

    There ARE ten speeches between Ex       the beginning
of the traditional  Ten Commandments   and Ex       
 where God actually gives Moses the two tablets with the 
Ten Commandments Discourses written on them    I break 
these ten down as follows                                 
                                                    
         and            In most cases  each of these 
passages begins with some variation of the phrase   And 
the LORD spoke to Moses  saying      The exception is 
Ex        which begins  Now these are the ordinances 
which you are to set before them    

    The word translated  commandments  in the phrase 
 the Ten Commandments  isn t really the word for 
 commandment   its the word for a speech  or an 
utterance   It s a word often used for longer discourses 
rather than individual statements  for instance  when 
combined with the word  yom   day   this word is 
translated  Chronicles  in such phrases as  now the rest 
of the acts of so and so  are they not written in the 
Chronicles of x       The word for  commandment  is 
freely used throughout the books of Moses  and perhaps 
it is significant that when Moses spoke of the Ten X s  
he appears to have avoided the word for commandment and 
chosen instead a word associated with discourses longer 
than just a single command 

    God tells Moses that He is going to give him the 
stone tablets  with the law and the commandments   Ex 
        yet He does not give Moses the tablets until He 
has finished all ten discourses on Mount Sinai   If the 
Ten Commandments were only Ex           it is not 
immediately clear why God would wait several days and 
nine more discourses before giving these tablets to 
Moses   On the other hand  if we have the Ten Discourses 
written on the tablets  then it makes perfect sense that 
God would not give Moses the tablets until He had 
finished delivering all Ten Discourses 

    When Moses did get the tablets  he found that both 
tablets were written on both sides  Ex           If 
these Ten  Commandments  were only the first    verses 
of Ex      God would have had to have written in LARGE 
letters   Not that He couldn t have  of course  but it 
does seem more likely to me that this is a reference to 
two tablets containing ten discourses written in normal 
sized letters 

    In II Cor     Paul seems to specifically single out 
the  commandments written on stone  as being the 
 ministry of death    that which is fading away   and 
 the ministry of condemnation    With the possible 
exception of the commandment about the Sabbath  it is 
difficult to see why Paul would refer to the commands in 
Ex          as being temporary   fading away  type 
commandments   This is less of a problem if the stone 
tablets should happen to have included all of the 
commandments from Ex    through Ex    

Arguments against this idea 

The main argument against this idea  aside from the fact 
that it contradicts a long standing tradition  is that 
in Dt       Moses says  after quoting the commands in 
Ex            These words the LORD spoke   and He added 
no more   And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and 
gave them to me    This appears to identify the words 
just quoted as being the only contents of the two stone 
tablets 

That was my first impression  anyway   However  after 
some thought  I noted that a great deal hinges on how 
you understand the phrase  These words    If Moses meant 
 These words  which I have just related to you  were 
spoken by God  etc   then that would mean that only the 
traditional  Ten Commandments  were on the stone 
tablets   If  however  Moses was making a parenthetical 
comment   These words  which I AM NOW telling you  were 
spoken by God  etc   then that s quite different 

I did note that in the Dt   account  Moses tells of 
being given the stone tablets BEFORE telling of the 
people asking Moses to represent them before God  
whereas in the Exodus account  the people asked this of 
Moses between the first and second discourses  several 
days BEFORE God gave Moses the stone tablets   This 
reinforces the idea that Moses  remarks in Dt     ff 
were intended as a parenthetical remark  rather than a 
strictly chronological account of when God wrote what  
and at what point He stopped adding to what was on the 
tablets 

Summary   all things considered  I find it somewhat more 
likely that the nine commands in Ex    are really only 
the first of what Moses regarded as the Ten Discourses 
of God   I don t know if anybody has ever espoused this 
idea before  it s brand new to me   So  while I lean 
towards accepting it  I would be very interested in 
hearing any comments and criticisms anyone may care to 
offer 

  Mark
