egaillou etu gel ulaval ca  Eric Gailloux  writes 

 I m about to purchase a laser printer for my Mac and I read the MacUser
 Buying Guide special issue  All HP printers  except IIISI  are rated very low
 compared to other noname bargain priced printers  Why is that so  On the PC 
 HP printers are THE standard amongst printer manufacturers 

 PS  My personnal favorite  budgetwise  would be the IIIP 

The IIIP has just been superseded by the  M  which is the one I am using at
work   The quality of the print is execellent  beating     dpi printers hands
down   In Australia the price of the  M is about comparable with that of the
III series  so HP are trying to get people to buy the new one
