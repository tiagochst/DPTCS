    Henry Spencer  writes 
   Does anyone have a reference  something I can look up  not just your own
   recollections    I have a few of those myself  on the temperature of the
    night  sky as seen from space 
  
  
     Henry  if I read you correctly  you may be asking  If I put a blackbody
  in interstellar space   disregarding the Sun and nearby large warm objects   
  what termperature will it reach in thermal equilibrium with the ambient
  radiation field  
  
     If that s the case  let me point out that interstellar dust and 
  molecules provide many instances of things that are  well  not too far
  from being blackbodies   Many different observations  including IRAS
  and COBE  have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures
  can range from   K to    K   

Yes  but that s because interstellar grains are very poor radiators  not
remotely black bodies   As a consequence they are a lot warmer than the
 ambient  
 
     Inside the disk of the galaxy  the temperature varies quite a bit
  from place to place  how close are you to the nearest OB association 
  I would guess    Outside the galaxy  of course  things aren t so 
  varied 
  

When I was in graduate school  a long time ago  we used        deg K with
a DILUTION FACTOR of      for representative values of the radiant energy
background in the galaxy due to starlight
