	There was a discussion a couple of weeks ago about using different
cables to 
achieve different resolutions on the Quadra and Centris series   A
company that sold the cables was mentioned   Can someone please e mail me
the companies name  address  etc  and any other info that may be relevant 


	 Just like everything else in life  the right lane ends in half a mile
