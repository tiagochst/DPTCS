I assume that can only be guessed at by the assumed energy of the
event and the   r   law   So  if the   r   law is incorrect  assume
some unknown material  dark matter    inhibits Gamma Ray propagation  
could it be possible that we are actually seeing much less energetic
events happening much closer to us   The even distribution could
be caused by the characteristic propagation distance of gamma rays 
being shorter then     the thickness of the disk of the galaxy 

Just some idle babbling
