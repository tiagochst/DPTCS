         If the  new  Kuiper belt object  is   called  Karla   the next
  one  should be called  Smiley  

Jeff responds 
 Unless I m imaging things   always a possibility         QB   the Kuiper Belt
 object discovered last year  is known as Smiley

I wouldn t worry too much about it  Jeff   If you work for JPL  then your
