 Davis Nicoll sez 
        Hmmm  I seem to recall that the attraction of solid state record 
  players and radios in the     s wasn t better performance but lower
  per unit cost than vacuum tube systems 

I d buy that for two reasons   The tubes for TV s and radios  if you can
still find them  are usually  x or more expensive than comparable transistors 

Also  ask any electric guitar enthusiast which type of amp they prefer  and
they ll tell you tube type  since tubes have lower distortion and noise
than transistors    Course  most of your electric guitar types just say
 Tubes sound better  dude      

Also  transistors have the advantage in both waste heat and energy use 
mainly because of the heaters on the cathodes of the tubes
