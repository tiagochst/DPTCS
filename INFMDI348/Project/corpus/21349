 Do you mean that your fellow Christians tend to find you wacky   Maybe  
 they re right   You might be interested in Franky Schaeffer s books  
 about what philistines American Christians are   Addicted to  
 Mediocrity  and more recently  Sham Pearls for Real Swine  

One day a few years ago Franky Schaeffer walked into a Greek Orthodox
Church   He is now an Orthodox Christian   So is his mother and if his
father  Fransis Schaeffer  had not passed away he too would have come
into the church   
Franky  like many Americans who have recently found the Orthodox church 
described the experience as finally coming home after a long jouney
through a desert   You should also read the book  Becoming Orthodox  by
Peter Gillquist   It describes the long journey of some      weary
Evangelical Protestants to the Orthodox church    Come taste and see how
good the Lord is
