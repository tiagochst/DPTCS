 Apparently not  Many people complain about the confusion that
 results from the filemanager progman split  It s just a basic
 flaw 
 
I have one thing to say   why does everyone say that spliting them up is
such a bad thing   I actually like my program launcher and file manager
do be seperate   it make things easier to figure out   I mean  take a look 
at OS   s wps     no flames     I personally hate it cause I just
have too much trouble figuring out how to do simple things like file copy  

and don t say  just drag the icon     Cause I hate icons in the first place 
I have too much trouble telling what all those little push buttons mean 
I want  F ile  C opy etc   

although I know I m in the minority
