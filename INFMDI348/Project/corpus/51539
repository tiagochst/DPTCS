In article      Apr                reed edu  especkma reed edu  Erik  A Speckman  writes 

 In the MacUser article on the new centris and quadra machines mentioned
 that the C    and the Q     and not the C     had ROM accelerated video 
 
 What is it   I don t recall seeing it in Dale Adams post 

of course it was in Dale s post  just not in the words that MacUser 
used   ROM accelerated video just means that some quickdraw commands
has been rewritten  inside the ROM  to take advantage of the      
addressing modes   commands that do fills should be slightly faster
since the new instructions fetch   bytes at a time versus one
