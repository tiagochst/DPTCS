  My friend recently purchased a LC III and he wants to know if there is
  such a demon called NuBus adapter for his PDS slot  

  The LC family of Macs can only
  use PDS cards  They are not able to use NuBus 

Ah  but why   Can some technically hip Macslinger tell us what the
difference is between PDS and Nubus   

Is it impossible to make a gadget that plugs into PDS and ends in a
Nubus card cage   At least  Marvin s friend has not been able to
locate one and neither have I   What is the fundamental reason for
this
