 In article   pi dhINN ub dsi dsinc com  perry dsinc com  Jim Perry  writes 
  Bigots never concede that their bigotry is irrational  it
  is other people who determine that by examining their arguments 
      
 No   I  expected it  You ve set yourself up a wonderful little
 world where a bigot is whomever you say it is   This is very 
 comfortable for you  imagine  never having to entertain an
 argument against your belief system   Simply accuse the person
 making of being a bigot   

Well  this particular thread of vituperation slopped its venom over
into alt atheism  where we spend most of our time entertaining
arguments against our belief system  without resorting to accusing
others of bigotry   It s somewhat ironic that our exposure to bigotry
happens in this instance to have originated in rec scouting  since I
always understood scouting to teach tolerance and diversity   I
understand bigotry to be irrational prejudice against other people who
happen to be of a different race  religion  ethnic background  sex  or
other inconsequential characteristics   All the evidence I ve seen
indicates that sexual orientation and lack of belief in gods are
exactly such inconsequential characteristics   Thus  pending further
evidence  I conclude that those who show prejudice against such people
are bigots  and organizations that exclude such people are
discriminatory
