hey folks 

I m fairly new to these groups  tho  some have heard from me before 

I d like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a
lot   What morals ethics apply to dreams and out of body incidents 
In normal dreams  you can t control anything  so obviously
you aren t morally responsible for your actions   But if you can contrive
to control the action in dreams or do an OOBE  it seems like a morality applies 

Now  there seem to be   alternatives 

   Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena   In this case no morality
applies beyond what might be called  mental hygiene   that is  not trying
to think about anything evil  or indulgining in overly sexy or violent
thoughts 

   Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own  i e  are  another plane  
Evidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in
common by more than one person   A
mark of objective fact is that    people report the same objective experience 
In this case  the same interpersonal morality ethics applies in dreams and
OOBEs as does in waking life 

   Like      but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a
real existence  a different moral ethics apply there  and no  or maybe 
different  moral laws apply there 

So    There it is   Is one of these cases the truth  or does anyone know
of another alternative   respond by post or email 

thanks very much
