I posted this a couple of weeks ago  and it doesn t seem to have appeared  
on the newsgroup  and I haven t had a reply from the moderator  We were  
having intermittent problems with our mail at the time  Please excuse me  
if you have seen this before   

Should Christians fight 

Last week Alastair posted some questions about fighting  and whether there  
are such things as  justifiable wars   I have started looking into these  
things and have jotted down my findings as I go  I haven t answered all  
his questions yet  and I know what I have here is on a slightly different  
tack  but possibly I ll be able to get into it more deeply later  and post  
some more info soon 

Our duty to our neighbour 

Do good to all men  Gal      
Love our neighbour as ourselves  Matt       

Act the part of the good Samaritan  Luke     toward any who may be in  
trouble  We will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured  
man  and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes  
people harm  even medical corps of the army etc  

Christians are by faith  citizens of the commonwealth of Israel   
 Ephesians           and also recognise that  God rules in the kingdoms of  
men   and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles  
of those nations which we are not part of due to our faith 

We are to be  strangers and pilgrims  amongst the nations  so we are just  
passing through  and not part of any nation or any national aspirations  
 this can also be applied to politics etc  but that s another story   We  
are not supposed to  strive  or  resist evil   even  suffer yourselves to  
be defrauded   it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in  
preserving a state which Christ will destroy when he returns to set up  
God s kingdom 

Our duty to the state 

 Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar s and unto God  
the things which be God s   Luke        
 Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers  For there is no power  
but of God  the powers that be are ordained of God  Whosoever resisteth  
the power  resisteth the ordinance of God   Rom         
 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord s sake  whether  
it be to king as supreme    for so is the will of God that with well doing  
ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men     Pet         

These scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a  
divine command  but it is equally clear from Acts         that when any  
ordinance of man runs counter to God s law  we must refuse submission to  
it  The reason for this is that we are God s  bond servants  and His  
service is our life s task  An example of the type of thing is in Col  
        where bondservants were to  work heartily as unto the Lord    so  
also we should work as if our boss was God   i e   Pressed down  shaken  
together  and running over     oops   a bit of a side track there   

In the contests between the nations  we are on God s side   a side that is  
not fighting in the battle  but is  testifying  to the truth 

When we believe in God and embrace His promises  we become  fellow  
citizens with the Saints and of the Household of God   and are no longer  
interested in associations of the world  Think of this in relation to  
unions etc as well  Paul tells us to  lay aside every weight  that we may  
run  the race that is set before us   and if we are wise  we will discard  
any association which would retard our progress    Thou therefore endure  
hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ  No man that warreth entangleth  
himself with the affairs of this life  that he may please him who hath  
chosen him to be a soldier     Tim        

One of these entanglements he warns about is  be ye not unequally yoked  
together with unbelievers   One of the obvious applications of this is  
marriage with unbelievers  but it also covers things like business  
partnerships and any other position where we may form a close association  
with any person or persons not believing the truth about God  in this case  
the army   The principle comes from Deut         remember that as well as  
them being different animals of different strengths  one was clean and one  
unclean under the law  These ideas are strongly stressed in   Cor          
  I suggest you read this  The yoking also has another aspect   that of  
servitude  and Jesus says  take my yoke upon you   so we are then yoked  
with Christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers  We have already seen  
that we are bondservants of Christ  and Paul says  become not ye the  
bondservants of men    Cor      RV  

An example from the Old Testament  the question is asked in   Chr       
 Shouldest thou help the ungodly       The situation here is a good  
example of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers   
Jehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life  Here are the facts 
   He had made an affinity with Ahab  who had  sold himself to work  
wickedness before the Lord     Kings        
   When asked by Ahab to form a military alliance  he had agreed and said  
 I am as thou art  my people as thy people     Kings         an unequal  
yoking 
   He sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted  
on hearing the prophet of the Lord  trying to do the right thing   he  
found that he was yoked and therefore couldn t break away from the evil  
association he had made 

God says to us  Come out from among them and be ye separate  and touch not  
the unclean thing  and I will receive you and ye shall be my sons and  
daughters     Cor       

This is more or less what I have found out so far   I m still looking into  
it  as I don t think I ve answered all the questions raised by Alastair  
yet  Heres a summary and a few things to think about 

The Christian in under command  Obedience to this command is an essential  
factor in his relationship with Christ  John           

Total dedication to this course of action is required  Romans         

Disobedience compromises the close relationship between Christ and his  
followers    Pet        

We are to be separated to God  Rom       This involves a master servant  
relationship  Rom          

No man can serve two masters  Matt             

All that is in the  Kosmos  is lust and pride   quite opposed to Gos     
John        Christs kingdom is not of this world  i e  not worldly in  
nature    if it was  his servants would fight to deliver him  If Christ is  
our master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom  
was not of this world  then his servants cannot possibly fight for another  
master 

Strangers and pilgrims have no rights  and we cannot swear allegiance to  
anyone but God 

The servant of the Lord must not war but be gentle to all    Tim          
this does not just apply to war  but also to avoiding strife throughout  
our lives  There is a war to be waged  not with man s weapons    Cor  
         but with God s armour  Eph         

I ll probably post some more when I ve had time to look into things a bit  
further
