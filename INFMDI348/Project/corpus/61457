In article  C A At E z zoo toronto edu  henry zoo toronto edu  Henry Spencer  writes 
 
 No  the thing is designed to be retrievable  in a pinch   Indeed  this
 dictated a rather odd design for the solar arrays  since they had to be
 retractable as well as extendable  and may thus have indirectly contributed
 to the array flapping problems 


Why not design the solar arrays to be detachable   if the shuttle is going
to retunr the HST   what bother are some arrays   just fit them with a quick release 

one  space walk   or use the second canadarm to remove the arrays
