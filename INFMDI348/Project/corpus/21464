      My mom passed along a lengthy review she clipped regarding Robin Lane
      Fox s book  The Unauthorized Version  Truth and Fiction in the Bible  
    
    I ve read the book  Some parts were quite typical regarding its
    criticism of the bible as an inaccurate historical document 
    alt altheism  etc carries typical responses  but not as vociferous as
    a a  It does give an insight into how these historian  is he one    I 
    don t have any biodata on him  work  I ve not been able to understand 
    appreciate some of the arguments  something like  it mentions certain 
    events  so it has to be after that event  and so on  

Robin Lane Fox is a historian and a gardener   He has written several
history books  perhaps a recent one you might remember is  The Search
for Alexander    He has also written or edited several books on
gardening
