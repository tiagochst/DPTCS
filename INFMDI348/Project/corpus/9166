  I have a question about WINBENCH  pc labs thing        
  
  I have a        and a Ahead B     k  card and got these results 
  
  windows vga driver        million
  ahead B               driver           winmarks
  windows svga              driver        million winmarks   
  
  I was thinking about upgrading to a diamond   x card   I read it had about
    million winmark  
 
 On my    dx   Mhz  Mb RAM
 Winbench    
    x v         M                 
      v         M                 
      v                           
      v                           

Be very careful with these results   As I recall  numbers from Winbench
    are calculated differently from      and so these figures are not
comparable 

However  to answer Stephen s question  replacing the Ahead B card with
a Diamond   x will yield a cost effective  dramatic speed increase for
Windows   That or the ATI Graphics Ultra Plus
