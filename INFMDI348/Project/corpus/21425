Woo  So far  we ve had the following interpretations of the figure of
the  Whore of Babylon  in Rev         

a  The United States of America
b  MHO dB  which was as a figure of the fallen spiritual powers who
   corrupt and oppress human society
c  Historical Jerusalem
d  Historical Rome

Dare I suggest that the passage might be many layered in meaning  How
about   The prophecy reveals God s judgement on the corrupt   idolatrous
state oppressing his chosen people  d    That God s judgement extends
 especially  to his once chosen city  c  because  despite that City s
special call  it still rejected God s grace at the decisive time  Rev
        also isn t Rev      equally suggestive of Rome as Jerusalem    
That the USofA is guilty of many of the crimes of Rome Babylon  a  and
is equally subject to God s judgement   That the Good Book TM  actually
encompasses  all  these viewpoints by revealing the corrupting spiritual
powers warring against mankind through the very society that we ve
created   b 

Clever  huh       Flame here   No need to argue at all  

I think Mary s view has a lot of sense because there seems to be a
deliberate contrast between Rev       and Rev         the mortal
Jerusalem chosen by God but never  historically  fulfilling its vocation
and the new Jerusalem perfected  outside of history  purely by God s
grace  eg Details like Rev          who sits on many waters  cf Rev   
the single stream in the new Jersualem  the river of life flowing from
the throne of God and of the Lamb  

Rex   didn t understand your post   what s the relevance of Babylonian
mystery religions to all this  Please elaborate your ideas about OT  
the Book of Rev  Why do you freak at the idea of a primarily  spiritual 
interpretation of Rev  I d mail  but I can t get thru
