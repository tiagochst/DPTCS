          Actually  my advisor  another classmate of mine  and me were talking
  the other day about putting just one detector on one of the Pluto satellites 
  THen we realized that the satellite alone is only carrying something like    
  pounds of eq   Well  a BATSE detector needs lead shielding to protect it 
  and   alone weighs about     pounds itself 

 Actually  the situation is even worse than that   The  total mass  of the
 Pluto Fast Flyby spacecraft is only    ish pounds  and most of that is
 support equipment like power and communications   The mass available for
 instruments is maybe     of that   I don t think a BATSE will fit   

From the Pluto Fast Flyby Instrument definition research anouncemnet 
the instrument payload constraints are 
    Mass allocation      kilograms       lbs 
    Power allocation     watts
    Required instruments 
	Visible imaging system      x     CCD      mm fl  f    optics 
	IR mapping spectrometer     x    HgCdTe array       energy resolution 
	UV spectrometer         nm      nm resolution 
	Radio science  ultrastable oscilator incorporated in telecom system 
		ultrastable means        

This doesn t leave much room for payloads which are totally unrelated
to the  mission of the spacecraft   In addition  the power will come
from a radioisotope thermal generator  and the whole space craft will
be about   feet in diameter  with no booms  which means there will be
strong gamma lines from Pu     and associated schmutz in the
background  which tends to reduce sensitivity somewhat 

It would still be nice  and our group here at Goddard is looking
in to it
