   to name a few of the verses that pertain to homosexuality 
 
 Homosexual Christians have indeed  checked out  these verses   Some of
 them are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations 
 Others simply do not address the issues 
 
 You would seem to be more in need of a careful and Spirit led course
 in exegesis than most of the gay Christians I know   I suggest that
 you stop  proof texting  about things you know nothing about

Well  Michael   I don t know if clh has left them in the faq   Maybe you should
post the  how to get there map again   but I posted two or three lengthy
exegetical paper on these verses   They looked at the OT  NT and
intertestimental usages of terms in reference   I would suggest you read those
before you talk about a  need  in exegetical studies   If those aren t enough 
I could also provide  The source and NT Meaning of Apsevokoitai    Dr James
DeYoung published it in THE MASTERS SEMINARY JOURNAL in fall of       To read
any of these   papers shows that the shoe is on the other foot as far as a need
for honest exegesis 

Again  please refer to the faq file  or if you are unable to acess it  drop me
a line and I will enclose them to you

yesterday     clh
