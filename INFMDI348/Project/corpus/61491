 In article  C  AGI MJu news cso uiuc edu  jbh      uxa cso uiuc edu  Josh Hopkins  writes 
  I m wondering if  vandalize  is the proper word to use in this situation   My
  dictionary defines  vandalism  as  the willful or malicious destructuion of 
  public or private property  especially of anything beautiful or artisitc   I
  would agree the sky is beautiful  but not that it is public or private property 

 It s public because it belongs to everybody  

No  the sky does not  at this time  belong to anyone   Ownership is necessary
to the definition because someone has to have the authority to decide if the
action was good or bad   If neither you or I own a brick wall  then I can t
unilaterally declare that spraypainting my name on it is right  and you don t
have the authority to declare that it is wrong   The owner may find it artistic
or she may be call the police 

 this applies to the argument on bright satellites more than street lights 

It s vandalism because many people    power companies    do maliciously waste light  

 maliciously  implies evil intent   The lighting companies aren t going out
of their way to spoil the sky   They just don t care 

 If they can sell you
 or your city or your state an unshielded light that wastes    to    percent
 of its light  they make more  money    Never mind that your money is wasted 

It is the responsibility of the customer to choose the most efficient hardware 
If that s what your city will buy  that s what the lighting company will sell 
Write a letter to city hall 

Please note that I m not defending light pollution   The orignial focus of 
this thread was space based light sources
