 I ve noticed an interesting phenomenon on my Centris      If I unplug the
 keyboard and mouse and plug them in again without turning the power off 
 the mouse suddenly switches to about half its normal movement speed  I check
 the  Mouse  control panel  and there s no change in its setting there  it s
 still on full speed  the way I like it  Restarting the machine restores the
 normal mouse speed 
 
 By the way  it happens with both the newer style mouse that came with the
 Centris  and the older style mouse from my IIfx at work  Thus I don t think
 it has anything to do with the resolution setting in the mouse  it s
 definitely a quirk of the ADB interface  either hardware or software  in the
 Centris itself 
 
I have noticed this exact same phenomenon occurs with my LCIII   Perhaps it is
a quirk of the new machines
