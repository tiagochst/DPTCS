       Stuff del d for bandwidth s sake 

 Why    sigh   If you don t have more than   MBs of memory using a RAMDrive
 with windows is a  waste  of memory   Windows will access upto   MB RAM better
 as memory   As to why what you did didn t work  it is because driveletters
 and paths are stored inside the group pif ini files   All of the sudden things
 went from drive c  to drive e    However  if you wanted to copy an application
 up to the RAMDrive and re setup it up  that should work normally  but as
 previously stated  this will only hurt things unless you ve got more than   MBs
 of RAM and are using whats above    as the RAMDrive 

 I personally have   MB s of RAM and run a   MB RAMDrive with a great deal of
 success   However  if you are looking to speed up windows  the three things
 I ve noted that work the best are 
 	   A graphics accellerator card
 	   A co processor  Even an emulator helps  
 	   Some other disk cache besides Smartdrive  I ve tried several 
 	   and Lightning for Windows and Norton Cache give me major
 	   headaches as well   

I think the purpose the original poster was trying to serve is to avoid the
SIGNIFICANT amount of disk access that Windows does on startup   It s like
it s trying to it s bit in wearing the damn drive out   I estimate it s only
reading a Mb of programs   data  but from the performance the drive gives  it
sounds like they are scattered all over the drive  my drive is however
regularily compressed    What is it that takes so much fuss   Perhaps if MS 
would take the trouble to optimize this startup process  less people would 
be wanting to find a solution themselves
