  Here s a question that some friends and I were debating last night 
  
  Q  If you knew beyond all doubt that hell did not exist and that
     unbelievers simply remained dead  would you remain a Christian 
  
  My contention is that if you answer this question with  No  I would
  not then remain a Christian  then you really are not one now   
  Following Jesus Christ has everything to do with sharing in
  his work and spreading the news that the Kingdom of Heaven is already
  among us   Fear based religion is not a faith relationship with the
  One Who made us all 

So does that mean that anyone who is a Christian to avoid Hell isn t really
a Christian at all  It sounds like it to me
