dt  cs hub ucsb edu  David E  Goggin  writes 

    Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena   In this case no morality
   
    Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own  i e  are  another plane  
   
    Like      but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have 
 a
 real existence  a different moral ethics apply there  and no  or maybe 
 different  moral laws apply there 


I can think of another alternative 

    OOBE s are a form of contact with the demonic world  whereby one 
intentionally or unintentionally surrenders control of his or her perceptions 
to spiritual beings whose purpose is to deceive and entrap them
