  I would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for Humans 
  I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere evolve given a range
  of physical aspects of the planet   The question is what physical aspects
  simply disallow earth like conditions 
 
     Dandridge Cole and Isaac Asimov collaborated on a book titled 
   Habitable Planets for Man   I think  in        It should be available
  in most good libraries  or through inter library loan
