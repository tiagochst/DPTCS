In article    BB A DF DJCOHEN YaleVM YCC Yale Edu  Daniel Cohen  
DJCOHEN YaleVM YCC Yale Edu writes  
  I ve noticed an interesting phenomenon on my Centris      If I unplug
the 
  keyboard and mouse and plug them in again without turning the power
off  
  the mouse suddenly switches to about half its normal movement speed  I 
  check the  Mouse  control panel  and there s no change in its setting 
  there  it s still on full speed  the way I like it  Restarting the
machine 
  restores the normal mouse speed  
  
  By the way  it happens with both the newer style mouse that came with
the 
  Centris  and the older style mouse from my IIfx at work  Thus I don t
think 
  it has anything to do with the resolution setting in the mouse  it s 
  definitely a quirk of the ADB interface  either hardware or software 
in 
  the Centris itself  

 I have noticed this exact same phenomenon occurs with my LCIII  Perhaps
it 
 is a quirk of the new machines  


Sorry  but mine works fine   C    

My   cents worth
