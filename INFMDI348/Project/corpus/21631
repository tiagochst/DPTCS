In article  May                        athos rutgers edu  JEK cu nih gov writes 

	   I will put enmity between you  the Serpent  and the woman  and
	  between your seed and her seed  she  can also be read he  shall
	  crush your head and you shall bruise her  or his  heel 
	   Genesis     

   In the Hebrew of Genesis       the gender is clearly masculine 

	  HE shall crush your head  and you shall bruise HIS heel 

   The Latin has feminine forms  only by an accident of grammar 

I have yet to see an adequate explanation of St  Jerome s translation
of Genesis        His Latin clearly uses the feminine  but I don t
know why  since the Hebrew is clearly masculine   If anyone knows of a
scholarly treatment of this puzzle  I would appreciate hearing from
you
