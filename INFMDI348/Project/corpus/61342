  Given that fact  and the spacecraft attitude knowledge
  of approx    arcmin  we might be able to figure out how well BATSE can
  determine the location  rotational  of a Gamma Ray burster from knowledge
  of the all sky map s accuracy   PR material for the other three instruments
  give accuracies on the order of  fractions of a degree   if that s 
  any help 
  
  But I believe that there is a fundamental difference here   The other x
  three instruments are focusing instruments  that  more or less  form
  an image  so positional errors are limited by craft attitude and the 
  resolving power of the optics   BATSE is an altogether different
  beast  effectively just   coincidence counters  one on each corner of 
  the craft   Positional information is triangulated from the 
  differential signal arrival times at each of the detectors 
  Positional error would be predominantly determined by timing errors
  and errors in craft attitude  Since none of the   BASTE detectors have
  any independant angular resolution whatsoever  they can not be used to
  determine parallax   Indeed  parallax would just add a very small 
  component to the positional error   
  
  Demonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would 
  require resolution on the order of arcseconds  since the oort 
  cloud is postulated to extend to about     parsec  all together 
  now   Parallax ARc SECond   a parsec is the distance of an object 
  that demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a   AU base line  
  If the   degree accuracy reported above is true  we re going to 
  have to add a BASTE to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline 
  
  The beauty of BASTE is that it both gives positional information and
  watches the entire sky simultaneously  a realy handy combination
  when you have no idea where the next burst is coming from

        Batse alone isn t always used to determine position   WHen a
particularly bright burst occurs  There are a couple of other detectors that
catch it going off   Pioneer    or    is the one I m getting at here   This
puppy is far enough away  that if a bright burst happens nearby  the huge
annulus created by it will hopefully intersect the line or general circle given
by BATSE  and we can get a moderately accurate position  Say oh    or  
degrees  That is the closest anyone has ever gotten with it   
        Actually  my advisor  another classmate of mine  and me were talking
the other day about putting just one detector on one of the Pluto satellites  
THen we realized that the satellite alone is only carrying something like    
pounds of eq   Well  a BATSE detector needs lead shielding to protect it  and  
alone weighs about     pounds itself 

        We decided against it
