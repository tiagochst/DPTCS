  I like option C of the new space station design   
  It needs some work  but it is simple and elegant  
  
  Its about time someone got into simple construction versus overly complex   
  
  Basically just strap some rockets and a nose cone on the habitat and go for
  it  
  
  Might be an idea for a Moon Mars base to   
  
  Where is Captain Eugenia sp  when you need it  reference to russian heavy
  lifter  I think
