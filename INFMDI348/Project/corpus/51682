Macintosh IIsi          ns 
Clock upgraded IIsi works well at   MHZ  however  does not work with
Nubus adaptor and     k disk even though it can read write    k disk
at  MHz  Interestingly  upgraded IIsi overcomes basically the fighting
between the Vedio and the System so that CPU never be reduced below   no
mater whether the cache is on or off  This is pretty useful when you
use the virtual memory of system
