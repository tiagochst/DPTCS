 Bruce Webster writes 
  Indeed  LDS doctrine goes one step further and in some cases
  holds parents responsible for their children s sins if they have
  failed to bring them up properly  cf  D C         

 Hi Bruce   How do you reconcile this practice with Ezekiel    
 Ezekiel        The soul who sins is the one who will die   The son will not
 share the guilt of the father  nor will the father share the guilt of the
 son   The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him  and
 the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him  

Actually in D C          the parents are being held accountable for
their own sins   Specifically they are accountable for their failure
to teach their children properly   If I fail to teach my children
that stealing is wrong then I am responsible for their theft if they
later indulge in such behavior 

This is very similar to the instructions Ezekiel was given in
Eze        If Ezekiel failed to do his duty and warn the wicked  
not only would the wicked die in his sins but the Lord would hold
Ezekiel responsible   Similarly parents are responsible to teach
their children right from wrong   I suspect most Christians  and
Jews etc   would agree that parents have this responsibility
