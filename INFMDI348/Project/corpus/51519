Excuse me if this is a frequent question  I checked in
several FAQs but couldn t really find anything 

I have a IIsi with the standard   meg memory and I want
 need  to add additional memory   But I m on a budget 
I really don t need more than    meg max  so what is
the best  performance wise  and most economical way
to do this   Someone told me that I should only use
SIMMs of the same amount of memory  that is     meg 
    meg  etc   What if I just wanted to buy just     meg
and use the rest of what I already have   The manual
hasn t been very helpful with this 

Thanks
