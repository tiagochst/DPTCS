About three weeks ago on the SPACE list  someone was quoting a source on the
relative traffic and rankings of this listserv   A figure of   th in
traffic    was given   Unfortunately I did not clip the message and I would
like to know the source of the rankings list   If anybody still has that
discussion on their disk or knows the source  or is the poster himself  
I d appreciate getting that reference   Being on the road I have temporarily
unsubscribed to the list to cut down mail box stuffing  g  so please reply
via e mail to lek aip org OR            compuserve com or I won t get your
answer
