I have a Macc IIci and a Color scanner 
I scanned a picture at     dpi  When I try to print
it on my HP    color printer  after    minutes of
making noise  the mac hangs  I would need to reboot it 
What does this mean  Do I need to buy more memory  I have
    MB now  I also have about    MB of disk free  and the
scanned picture is about    MB
