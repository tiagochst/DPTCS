  Excuse me if this is a frequent question  I checked in
  several FAQs but couldn t really find anything 

You are excused    the answer varies from Mac to Mac so it would be
a complex answer in the FAQ 
  
  I have a IIsi with the standard   meg memory and I want
   need  to add additional memory   But I m on a budget 
  I really don t need more than    meg max  so what is
  the best  performance wise  and most economical way
  to do this   Someone told me that I should only use
  SIMMs of the same amount of memory  that is     meg 
      meg  etc   What if I just wanted to buy just     meg
  and use the rest of what I already have   The manual
  hasn t been very helpful with this 
  
The si uses a    bit wide data bus and therefore you must use     bit
wide simms   Sorry  but no short cuts here 

  Thanks 

You re quite welcome 
  
Greg
