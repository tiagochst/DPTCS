In article  C   HE I q news ucs mun ca  rcampbel weejordy physics mun ca  Roderick Campbell  writes 
  There is a free unix  linux  that has cc   c    fortran   f c   
  Xwindows and many other features besides  with a large number of utilities
  that can be optionally added  And there is also a free    BSD I believe 
  Both these unix s are quite robust  You can check out comp os linux

i dunno about linux  but for    bsd  don t forget networking
 well tested  at that   NFS  a fast  incredibly stable filesystem 
and the list goes on        

for us    bsd folk  look in comp os    bsd
