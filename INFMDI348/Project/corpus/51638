     Doesn t a   MB SIMM have about                 moving flip flops 

   They don t move  to anybody much bigger than an electron    

Dynamic RAM is not based on flip flops  there s basically a single
transistor and capacitor to store each bit   Static RAM is based on
flip flops  and is much more expensive and much less dense   And
neither has any parts that  move   if electrons and thermal expansion
are ignored   

   noah
