   May     D  Andrew Byler writes to All 

 DAB  I think I need to again post the Athanasian Creed  whicc pretty well
 DAB  delinieates orthodox Christian belief on the Trinity  and on the
 DAB  Incarnation 

 DAB  It s a pretty good statement of the beliefs eventually accpeted  and the
 DAB  Creed is in use by the Catholic Church  as well as the Lutheran 
 DAB  Anglican  and Orthodox churches  the last minus the filioque  which they
 DAB  delete from the original form of the creed  

Do you have any evidence that it is used by the Orthodox Churches 

As far as I know it is purely Western  like the  Apostles  Creed   The
Orthodox Churches use the  Symbol of Faith   commonly called  The
Nicene Creed
