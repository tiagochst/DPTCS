  I haven t seen any specifics on the HST repair mission  but I can t see why
  the mass margins are tight   What are they carrying up   Replacement components
   WFPC II  COSTAR  gyros  solar panels  and probably a few others   all sorts of
  tools  EVA equipment  and as much OMS fuel and consumables as they can   This
  should be lighter than the original HST deployment mission  which achieved the
  highest altitude for a shuttle mission to date   And HST is now in a lower 
  orbit   
  
  Seems like the limiting factors would be crew fatigue and mission complexity

One thing to recall   Putting a satellite as high as possible is one thing  
Coming back to not only that altitude  but matching the position of it in 
its orbit on a subsequent mission is another thing   Any misalignment of the 
plane of the orbit during launch or being ahead or behind the target will 
require more fuel to adjust   This was considered in the original deployment  

I agree though that the demands on the crew and complexity are stupendous   
One has to admire how much they are trying to do
