  The Forever War   one of my favorite SciFi books  had a passage devoted to 
 breathing fluids  The idea was to protect people from the high accelerations 
 required for interstellar travel by emersing the passengers in dry cleaning 
 fluid saturated with oxygen  Plenty of very imaginative ideas is this book 
 I would certainly recommend it  won the Hugo and the Nebula awards  

And most definitely read it in conjunction with Heinlein s  Starship
Trooper    The two books are radically different viewpoints of the
same basic premises   I ve even heard tell of English classes built
around this 

   
 Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don t have the balls to live
