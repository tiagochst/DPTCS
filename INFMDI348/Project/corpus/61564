  No   A  dragless  satellite does not magically have no drag  it burns fuel
  constantly to fight drag  maintaining the exact orbit it would have  if 
  there was no drag   

     Well  almost  It turns out that clever orbital mechanics can 
engineer things so that resonant interactions with the higher order 
harmonics of the Earth s gravitational field can pump energy into a 
satellite  and keep it from experiencing drag effects for periods of 
months to years  

     My favorite example of this is the Soviet Russian heavy ELINT 
satellites of the Cosmos      class  which are in      resonance  In 
particular  C     has undergone two periods of prolonged  gain  in 
altitude  the current one having started in June       the mean altitude 
of the satellite is now as high as it has ever been since launch on    
March        Looking at the elements for C     also shows the 
limitations of NORAD s software    but that s another story   

    This probably has little relevance to space stations  since the    
degree orbits of the C     satellites are at     km  which is 
unacceptably far into the inner van Allen belt for manned platforms  But 
it s kind of interesting from the point of view of the physics of the 
situation  

     Orbital elements for these satellites are available on request

Is there an opinion here  If so  it s mine  not SAIC s
