Can someone please help me understand the current situation
regarding SIMMS 

I have a IIsi which I will probably keep for another   years 

I would like to add more memory  ie go from   MB to    MB 

I know that I will need   x  MB    ns or faster SIMMS 

Which SIMMS     pin or    pin 
Would the SIMMS I get today be usable in   years with a 
newer  more powerful system 

Any insight would be appreciated 

Thanks 

Rob
