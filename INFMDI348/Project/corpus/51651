I remember reading a thread a few days ago that mentioned removing an external
syquest drive from its case and dropping it in the internal drive of a Centris 
    I was going to do that with my      but had a couple of questions   My
PLI   M syquest drive has a wire from the drive to an id  switch on the
outside of the case   Where do I connect this switch    Can the computer just
 tell  with internal drives   
	I noticed that the drive will lay over part of the motherboard  I
didn t look closely  but I seem to recall it laying over the ram that s
soldered onto the motherboard   Would that cause problems 
	One last question   Is there anywhere to order a faceplate cover   
the drive s front panel is smaller than the space left in the case  the
drive s panel is the same size as the spotsBM clone s cases    Should I just
cut a hole in the plastic panel that is currently holding tmpty place 

Ans are welcomed   Thanks
