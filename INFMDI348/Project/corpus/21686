On Thursday   May       Dave Davis writes 

   I m leaning    SIRACH    is more directly referenced by JAMES
   than JOB or RUTH is    in any NT verse I ve seen 

It would help if you mentioned chapter and verse from SIRACH and
from JAMES 

Job        He taketh the wise in their craftiness   seems to be
quoted in   Corinthians      

James        You have heard of the patience of Job    while not a
quote  implies that James and his listeners are familiar with a
story of a man named Job who exhibited exemplary patience  It is
possible that the story they know is not that found in the Hebrew
Bible  but rather another similar and related story   One has the
same problem with direct quotes  

Again  Matthew       Boaz begat Obed of Ruth   tells us that Matthew
knew a story about a woman named Ruth who married a man called Boaz
and  became the ancestor of David  Since Ruth is not mentioned in
the OT outside the Book of Ruth  it seems likely that Matthew was
familiar with the book and respected it  and thought Ruth important
enough to be one of the few women mentioned in the genealogy 

References like this do not prove that the NT writer considered his
OT source inspired or inerrant or canonical  But neither do direct
quotes
