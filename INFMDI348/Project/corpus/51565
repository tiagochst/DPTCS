Finally got my computer fixed and I d like to sum up 

About hard drive companies  the original     meg drive that was bad  bad
sector or something  was an IBM   The new one is a Quantum   Is the LCIII
supposed to be shipped with IBMs   Is there a quality difference  
Apparently    

Second  about hard drive position   I ve put the LCIII on its side and
the new     HD has had no problems at all   I ve even switched back and
forth between horizontal and vertical and there are no problems   As far
as I m concerned I don t believe HD position is important for drives up
to     meg  in any computer   Don t know about CD ROM  though
