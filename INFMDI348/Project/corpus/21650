In a post of    April      considering disasters as instances of the
judgements of God in history  Andy Byler spoke of

   the desire of the Jerusalem mob who crucified the Lord that
    His blood be upon us  

Vera Noyes replied     May  

   I will not comment here for fear of being heavily flamed 

I invite them both  and other interested parties as well  to read my
comments on this verse of Scripture  To obtain them  send the
message GET CHOOSING BARABBAS to LISTSERV ASUACAD BITNET or to
LISTSERV ASUVM INRE ASU EDU  Putting it briefly  I think that the
significance of the demands of the Jerusalem crowd has usually been
greatly misunderstood  both by Christian and by anti Christian
readers 

 Yours 
 James Kiefer

 You should send email to that address  with the contents of the
message being a single line containing the GET command   The
subject line is apparently ignored  at least by ASUVM     clh
