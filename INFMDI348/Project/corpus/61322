     re  voyages of discovery    
    Could you give examples of privately funded ones 

 If you believe       the film   Columbus had substantial private
 funds   When Columbus asked the merchant why he put the money in  the
 guy said  slightly paraphrased     There is Faith  Hope and Charity 
 But greater than these is Banking  
   

Heck  some of his ships were loaners  One was owned by a Basque   
 you know  one of those groups that probably crossed the Atlantic
 before  Columbus came along
