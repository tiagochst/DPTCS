 I say 
 What I m objecting to here is a floating billboard that  presumably 
 would move around in the sky   I  for one  am against legislating
 at all   I just wish that people had a bit of common courtesy  and
 would consider how their greed for money impacts the more ethereal and
 aesthetic values that make us human   This includes the need for wild
 and unspoiled things  including the night sky 


Sorry that s an aesthetics argument   maybe this string shoudl mofe to
sci space aesthetics 

Planes  ruin the night sky   Blimps ruin the night sky   Radio towers
ruin the night sky   

Like i said   get a vote  and create some more national parks   which
include onobstructed air space
