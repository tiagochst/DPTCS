 Has anyone out there in netland any experience with accelerators
 for SE  I am specially interested in 
     speed up rate    or compared to e g  SE    
     need for new SIMMs  speed in ns 
     maximum RAM after upgrade
     compatibility  I am mainly using FrameMaker 
     can I use an additional  big b w screen      to     
     can I install the accellerator myself  no soldering 
     price where to buy
 
I have no experience with this particular hardware  but
just about every month in Macworld there is an add for
an combined SE accelerator Video board   This item sells
for about       and comes with a   MHz             pair 
eight SIMM slots  and a grayscale     monitor 

This accelerator plugs into the SE s lone expansion port
and thus no soldering   You will however  need a long
TORX wrench to get the case open  but that s not really
a big deal  

Does that sound like what you were looking for
