  As for human tolerances  the best example of human endurance in terms
  of altitude  i e  low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure 
  is in my opinion to the scaling of Mt  Everest without oxygen assistance   
      This is quite a feat of physiological endurance   
 
 Indeed so  it s at the extreme limit of what is humanly possible   It is
 possible only because Mount Everest is at a fairly low latitude   there
 is a slight equatorial bulge in the atmosphere    beyond what is induced
 by the Earth s rotation    thanks to the overall circulation pattern of
 the atmosphere  air cools at poles and descends  flowing back to equator
 where it is warmed and rises   and this helps just enough to make Everest 
 without oxygen feasible   Only just feasible  mind you   the guys who did
 it reported hallucinations and other indications of oxygen starvation 
 and probably incurred some permanent brain damage 

Climbers regard      metres and up as  The Death Zone    Even on      Oxygen 
you are slowly dying   At     m  Everest   most climbers spend only a short
period of time before descending   I ve been above      once   Descending as
little as    m feels like walking into a jungle  the air is so thick   Everest
in winter without oxygen  no support party  Alpine style    That is the
 ultimate challenge   or is it solo
