bruce liv ac uk  Bruce Stephens  suggests different levels of acceptance of
homosexuality 
  
     Regard homosexual orientation as a sin  or evil  whatever 
     Regard homosexual behaviour as a sin  but accept orientation
   though presumably orientation is unfortunate  and dislike people who
  indulge
     As    but  love the sinner 
     Accept homosexuality altogether 

I would add     our churches should accept homosexual orientation but hold all
people to certain standards of sexual behavior   Promiscuity  abuse of power
relationships  harrassment  compulsivity are equally out of place in the lives
of homosexual as of heterosexual people 

Of course  this would bring up the dread shibboleth of homosexual marriage 
and we couldn t have that
