 I am taking a course entitled  Exploring Science Using Internet  
 For our final project  we are to find a compendium of Internet resources 
 dealing with a science related topic  I chose Astronomy  Anyway  I was 
 wondering if anyone out there knew of any interesting resources on Internet
 that provide information on Astronomy  space  NASA  or anything like that
