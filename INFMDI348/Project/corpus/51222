     God is eternal      A   B 
     Jesus is God        C   A 
     Therefore  Jesus is eternal    C   B 
  
     This works both logically and mathematically   God is of the set of
     things which are eternal   Jesus is a subset of God    Therefore
     Jesus belongs to the set of things which are eternal 

The first premise and the conclusion are not properly translated as identity
statements  since the  is  in those statements is the  is  of predication
rather than of identity   Instead  they should be translated using a
predicate letter   Using  g  to designate God and  j  to designate Jesus 
and the predicate letter  E  for the property of being eternal  the
first premise is Eg and the conclusion is Ej 
    The second premise appears to contain an  is  of identity  in which
case it can be properly symbolized as j   g   But your remark that  Jesus
is a subset of God  suggests that strict identity is not desired here 
If  however  the first premise means that all members making up the set
God have the property of being eternal  the same conclusion follows
