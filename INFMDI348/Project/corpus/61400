  I don t think touting contributions is a good idea   World War II produced
  many many beneficial spinoffs   Eg  Radar  jet aeroplanes  rocket technology 
  I don t think anyone would argue that World War II was  in and of itself 
  a good thing 
  
  If you want people to back the space program it must be a good thing in
  and of itself 

I disagree with what to tout  although I agree that the space program is
inherently a good thing   Most people today only care about  what will it
cost me   and  what s in it for me   and could care less about whether
something is simply worthwhile in and of itself   Our society has become
increasingly geared toward the short term  which you could read as NOW    
They couldn t care less about next week  much less next century   They want
something to show for the expenditure and they want it  now  

I think we  should  tell them about the things that they are using now that
are spinoffs of the space program   That is the only way you can  prove 
its worth to  them    and they vote and pay taxes too   The continued
existence of the space program relies upon that money 

just my     

BTW  don t forget Velcro
