  COMMERCIAL SPACE NEWS SPACE TECHNOLOGY INVESTOR NUMBER   
     
     This might point out some key discriminators in judging the 
  feasibility of a commercial launch site   These include 
      Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage 
  sufficient to recover setup costs 
      Is there a market advantage of using the site 
      Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site 
      Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the 
  investment   
     Other commercial launch site ventures    including those at 
  Woomera  Poker Flat  Cape York  White Sands  Alabama Off Shore 
  Platform  Hawaii  and Vandenberg have to also be judged against 
  these criteria   In my opinion  some of these ventures are flying 
  on hope and speculation  and not on sound financial grounds  

This reminds me    my fuzzy brain recalls that somebody was thinking
of reviving the San Marco launch platform off the coast of Kenya 
where the Copernicus satellite was launched around        Is this
true  or am I imagining it   Possibly it s connected with one of the
Italian programs to revive the Scout in a new version 

That old platform must be getting pretty rusty  and there ain t a lot
of infrastructure to go with it
