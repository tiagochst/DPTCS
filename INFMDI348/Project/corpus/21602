 I also don t see the  necessity  of saying the Holy Parents were some 
 how sanctified beyond normal humanity  it sounds like our own inability
 to grasp the immensity of God s grace in being incarnated through an or 
 dinary human being   


When Elizabeth greeted Mary  Elizabeth said something to the effect that
Mary  out of all women  was blessed   If so  it appears that this
exactly places Mary beyond the sanctification of normal humanity
