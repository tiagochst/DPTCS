In article  May                        athos rutgers edu  KEVXU cunyvm bitnet writes 
 
 Isn t Origen usually cited as the most prestigious proponent of reincarnation
 among Christian thinkers   What were his views  and how did he relate them
 to the Christian scriptures 

He appears to have believed that   He had a view which was condemned by conciliar
action  which is often taken to be condemnation of the idea of reincarnation 
What was actually condemned was the doctrine of the pre existence of the soul
before birth   Similar  but not exactly the same thing
