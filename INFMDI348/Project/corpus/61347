  Henry Spencer  writes 
  Does anyone have a reference  something I can look up  not just your own
  recollections    I have a few of those myself  on the temperature of the
   night  sky as seen from space 
 
  Note  I am  not  talking about the temperature of the Microwave Background
  Radiation   There are more things in the sky than just the MBR  what I m
  after is total blackbody temperature    what a thermal radiator would see 
  disregarding  or shielding against  the Sun and nearby large warm objects 

   Henry  if I read you correctly  you may be asking  If I put a blackbody
in interstellar space   disregarding the Sun and nearby large warm objects   
what termperature will it reach in thermal equilibrium with the ambient
radiation field  

   If that s the case  let me point out that interstellar dust and 
molecules provide many instances of things that are  well  not too far
from being blackbodies   Many different observations  including IRAS
and COBE  have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures
can range from   K to    K   You might look in a conference proceedings
 Interstellar Processes   ed  D  J  Hollenbach and H  A  Thronson  Jr  
published in        Try the articles by Tielens et al   Seab  and 
Black 

   Inside the disk of the galaxy  the temperature varies quite a bit
from place to place  how close are you to the nearest OB association 
I would guess    Outside the galaxy  of course  things aren t so 
varied 

   I hope this is what you were looking for
