Interesting point   The Bible doesn t say  hate the sin  
It tells to avoid sin  resist sin  even  when necessary  denounce sin 
But not hate

 The following passages all talk about God or people God approves of
hating sin or some other action   Ps         also talks about hating
the sinner   I believe there are other passages that would talk about
hating someone who is evil  but I didn t turn them up in this search
 which was on the word  hate  in the KJV  though I ve crosschecked
each passage in the NRSV  

Ps                                                          
Prov           
Isa     
Amos     
Zec
