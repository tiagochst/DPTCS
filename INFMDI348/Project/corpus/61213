  A transporter operator      That better be one important transport   Usually  
  it is a nameless ensign who does the job   For such a guest appearance I would  
  have expected a more visible meaningful role

Better idea for use of NASA Shuttle Astronauts and Crew is have them be found
lost in space after a accident with a worm hole or other space time glitch  

Maybe age Jemison a few years  makeup and such  and have her as the only
survivour of a failed shuttle mission that got lost   

Heh of late  they way they have been having shuttle problems in the media 
anything can happen   

Imagine a Astronaut Crew member to find themselves in the   th Century as the
object of interest of an alien civilization  maybe rescued or helped by the ST
Enterprise     I know Vegr and such was okay  but this could be better
