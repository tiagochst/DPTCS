  Also  ask any electric guitar enthusiast which type of amp they prefer  and
  they ll tell you tube type  since tubes have lower distortion and noise
  than transistors    Course  most of your electric guitar types just say
   Tubes sound better  dude      

 Of course   they then  turn up the REverb  the Gain   add in the analog
 delay line  and the Fuzz box   I d think they wouldn t notice the
 distortion    Oh I forgot the phase shifters 

It is kind of absurd  isn t it   Some players even want more distortion 
especially the Hendrix fans      But there are a lot of them out there
that can only afford the amp  or who like playing music without distortion 
Then there are your hard core Hendirx fans that want particular  types 
of distortion  i e   they make it  not their amps 

  Also  transistors have the advantage in both waste heat and energy use 
  mainly because of the heaters on the cathodes of the tubes 

 Ah   but how do they compare to Mechanical systems    

I didn t see a thing about waste heat from Babbage  and haven t seen one
of those mechanical TV s in a while  so it s anybodie s guess
