 Floptical is  of course a different technology  and doesn t enjoy the
long
 term data storage of opticals   And the last time I looked  floptical
disk
 weren t all that cheap       per floptical disk         per megabyte     
 per sysquest is       per megabyte  


I don t know how many times I ve posted this the net   No one EVER
listens   

Once and for all   Floptical Media is only       a megabyte if you don t
know where to buy it   I am bying my flopticals at     per   disks   I
see that as      a meagabyte  NOT         No  I m not buying in bulk  I m
not getting a special deal        a meg is good in my book  Approching
floppy price
