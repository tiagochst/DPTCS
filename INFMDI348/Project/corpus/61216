Subject  Next stand off 
Status  R

Redwood City  CA  API     A tense stand off entered its third week
today as authorities reported no progress in negotiations with
charismatic cult leader Steve Jobs 

Negotiators are uncertain of the situation inside the compound  but
some reports suggest that half of the hundreds of followers inside
have been terminated   Others claim to be staying of their own free
will  but Jobs  persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm 

In conversations with authorities  Jobs has given conflicting
information on how heavily prepared the group is for war with the
industry   At times  he has claimed to  have hardware which will blow
anything else away   while more recently he claims they have stopped
manufacturing their own 

Agents from the ATF  Apple Taligent Forces  believe that the group is
equipped with serious hardware  including     caliber pieces and
possibly Canon equipment 

The siege has attracted a variety of spectators  from the curious to
other cultists   Some have offered to intercede in negotiations 
including a young man who will identify himself only as  Bill  and
claims to be the  MS iah  

Former members of the cult  some only recently deprogrammed  speak
hesitantly of their former lives  including being forced to work
   hour days  and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies   There were
frequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of
 interpersonal computing  which rejects traditional roles 

Late night vigils on Chesapeake Drive are taking their toll on
federal marshals   Loud rock and roll  mostly Talking Heads  blares
throughout the night   Some fear that Jobs will fulfill his own
apocalyptic prophecies  a worry reinforced when the loudspeakers
carry Jobs  own speeches    typically beginning with a chilling  I
want to welcome you to the  Next World
