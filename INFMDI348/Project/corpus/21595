 But I am interested in your claim that early Christian practices  parallel  
 Mormon temple ceremonies   Could you give an example   Also  why do they only 
 parallel Mormon ceremonies   Why don t Mormon ceremonies restore the original 
 Christian practices   Wasn t that the whole point of Joseph Smith s stated 
 mission 

If you want parallels the best source is probably the book  Temple
and Cosmos  by Hugh Nibley   It is not light reading however 

As to why these early practices  only parallel  and do not exactly
duplicate the modern LDS ceremony  there are a couple of reasons 

    Quite likely we do not have the exact original from ancient
times   This stuff was not commonly known but bits and pieces
undoubtedly spread    Much as bits and pieces of the modern ceremony
get known    What we have in the    day literature  the Egyptian
ceremonies  and certain Native American ceremonies is almost
certainly not exactly what Jesus taught 

    Certain aspects of the ceremony are normally modified to fit the
situation  much as the modern ceremony has been modified to fit the
audio visual tools now available
