      The Onboard Flight Software project was rated  Level    by a NASA team 
      This group generates       KSLOCs of verified code per year for NASA 
 
 Will someone tell an ignorant physicist where the term  Level    comes
 from  It sounds like the RISKS Digest  equivalent of Large  Extra
 Large  Jumbo    Or maybe it s like  Defcon      
 
 I gather it means that Shuttle software was developed with extreme
 care to have reliablility and safety  and almost everything else in
 the computing world is Level    or cheesy dime store software   Not
 surprising   But who is it that invents this standard  and how come
 everyone but me seems to be familiar with it 

Level   refers to the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute s
Capability Maturity Model   This model rates software development
org s from      with   being Chaotic and   being Optimizing   DoD is
beginning to use this rating system as a discriminator in contracts   I
have more data on thifrom   page to        I have a       page
presentation that summarizes it wethat I could FAX to you if you re
interested
