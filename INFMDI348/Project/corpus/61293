The following is what they feed to us      most has been posted already 
but there are a number of items not seen here yet     

Redesign Activities Update    Following is the weekly status on redesign 
based on information provided by NASA headquarters 

The station Redesign Team  SRT  provided a detailed status report to the
Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April      The
day long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City  VA  topics
covered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for
the space station  science  technology and engineering research  the
assessment process  and the design approach  Discussions on management
options and operations concepts also were held 

The Design Teams then presented the three options under study 

  Option A   Modular Buildup    Pete Priest presented the A option  Priest
said the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has
identified three distinct phases of evolution   power station  human tended
and permanent presence  The team will define the minimum capability needed
to achieve each phase  the total cost of each phase and the achievable
capability for budget levels  The A option uses current or simplified
Freedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing
systems such as the so called  Bus   spacecraft   the orbiter and Spacelab 

The Power Station Capability could be achieved in   flights with Freedom
photo voltaic modules providing    kW of power     day Shuttle Spacelab
missions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase 

Human Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U S 
Common Module Module which adds subsystems and   payload racks and docking
ports for ESA and Japanese laboratories     day missions with the orbiter
docked to the station are assumed for this phase  Different
operation utilization modes are being studied for this phase 

  Option B   Freedom Derived    Mike Griffin presented the status of Option
B activities  Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom derived option 
from initial Research Capability  to Human Tended Capability  to Permanent
Human Presence Capability  to Two Fault Tolerance  and finally Permanent
Human Capability  Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the
baseline program  with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking
system  Crew Health Care System and ECLSS  and a major change to the Data
Management System 

Initial Research Capability would be achieved with   flights to      degree
inclination    flights to      degrees  and consist of an extended duration
orbiter Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with   photo voltaic
arrays providing       kW of power 

Human Tended Capability would be achieved in   flights and add truss
segments and the U S  lab 

Permanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in   flights with two
orbiters providing habitation and assured crew return 

Two Fault Tolerance  achieved in    flights  would build out the other
section of truss with another set of PV modules  thermal control and
propulsion systems 

The freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete
state with    flights   Three more flights  to bring up the habitat module 
a third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles  ACRV  would complete
the Permanent Human Capability with International stage 

Griffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware
would not  by itself  meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived
option   Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including
program management  contractor non hardware  early utilization and
operations costs  he said 

  Option C   Singe Launch Core Station    Chet Vaughn presented Option C 
the Single Launch Core Station concept   A Shuttle external tank and solid
rocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit   Shuttle
main engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch
and jettisoned after ET separation 

The module     feet in diameter and    feet long  would provide       
cubic feet of pressured volume  separated into    decks  connected by a
centralized passageway   Seven berthing ports would be located at various
places on the circumference of the module to place the international
modules  and other elements   This  can  would have two fixed photo voltaic
arrays producing approximately    kW of power flying in a solar interial
attitude 

In his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee  Bryan O Connor
said a design freeze would be established for the   options on April    so
that detailed costing of the options can begin   The next meeting with the
Redesign Advisory Committee will be May   

Russian Consultants Arrive in U S     A delegation of    Russian space
experts arrived in the U S  on April    and briefings to the SRT by members
of the Russian team began on the   nd   The group includes Russian Space
Agency General Director Y  M  Koptev  and V  A  Yatsenko  also of the RSA  
Others on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense 
the Design Bureau SALYUT  the Institute of Biomedical Problems  the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs  NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH   The Russian team
briefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system  docking
systems  the Proton launch vehicle  Mir operations and utilization  and the
Soyuz TM spacecraft 

The Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities
of the Mir space station  and the possible use of Mir and other Russian
capabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign   They will
be available to the SRT through May   

Management and Operations Review Continues     Work continued in the SRT
subgroups   The Management Group under Dr  Walt Brooks is working to
develop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a
foundation for the transition to development and operations   Various
management options have been developed including 

  Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of
command 

  Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an Associate
Administrator 

  Skunk Works Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co located
hand picked program office 

  Combine Space Station with Shuttle  with the space station becoming an
element of the current program 

  Major Tune Up to Current Organization  with current contracts and
geographical distribution maintained but streamlined 

The Operations Group under Dr  John Cox is building on the work of the
Operations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA JSC  which had
already begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its
preliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible 

As part of its work   the Operations Group has identified teams of agency
experts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of
assembly and operations  utilization  maintenance and logistics and testing
and ground operations 

What s in the Week Ahead     The Design Support Teams will provide a
comprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday
and Tuesday at which point the design will be  frozen  to begin the
detailed cost assessment    Also this week  the team will begin preparing
for the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee  to
be held May   

Dr  Shea Steps Down     Dr  Joe Shea stepped down as director of the
Station Redesign Team on April    and Bryan O Connor will take over the
activities of the team   Dr  Shea submitted his resignation as assistant
deputy administrator for space station analysis  but will continue to serve
as a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available to
consult with the SRT  Mr Goldin accepted the resignation so that a request
from Dr  Shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated 

Key Milestones    The key dates for the SRT as they are currently being
carried on the schedule are
