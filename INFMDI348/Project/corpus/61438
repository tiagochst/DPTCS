 I expect that retrieving HST would involve  damaging  it considerably in
 order to return it to its cradle in the cargo bay   Most of the deployed
 items  antennas and  especially  the solar arays  probably are not
 retractable into their fully stowed position  even by hand   

No  the thing is designed to be retrievable  in a pinch   Indeed  this
dictated a rather odd design for the solar arrays  since they had to be
retractable as well as extendable  and may thus have indirectly contributed
to the array flapping problems 

The retrieval problems are exactly as stated   it would be costly  would
involve extensive downtime  and the worry of someone finding a reason not
to re launch it   and would unnecessarily expose the telescope to a lot
of mechanical stresses and possibilities for contamination
