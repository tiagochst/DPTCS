Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one
another with all wisdom  and as you sing psalms  hymns and spiritual songs with
gratitude in your hearts to God  
Colossians     

A reminder  These verses are from the New International Version  As with any
translation  faithfulness to the original Hebrew and Greek may vary from time
to time  If a verse sounds a little off occasionally  compare it with another
translation or with the original texts  if you are able to do so 

God Bless You
