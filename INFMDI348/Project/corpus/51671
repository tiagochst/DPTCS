Hello all 

For few past days I ve been fighting to get My NEC Multisync  D
 predecessor of  FG  to work properly with the internal video of Mac
IIvi 

With a VGA adapter  as described in Dale Adams  posting about Quadra
video  it works  only some minor interferences occur  small enough not
to prevent any action on screen to be visible   clear 

But because the scanrates   stuff of  D are well enough for emulating
Apple     RGB  I first made an adapter  then got one fron the local
distributor of NEC 
With both adapters I can get a picure  which looks excellent most of
the time or every now and then 
But with radical changes on screen  opening palettes  large windows
etc   there are major interferences in sync  The picture either tilts
sideways or scrables up totally  Even when it is clear  there are some
 spiky  interferences on horizontal line alignment when accessing
pull downs etc 
With the self made adapter  almost identical to the VGA one  only
sense pins differ  it is sometimes impossible to even boot up with a
picture clear enough to shut down from menu   
With the adapter from NEC  everything is well most of the time  but
sometimes the picture tilts badly sideways or the sync is completely
lost  But not nearly as often as with the self made one 

I know  with self made adapters there can always be interference  but
with the one provided by NEC    where s the source of this interference 

I ll give you the pinouts of the whole mess  and I hope that you can 
at least someone  please try    figure out what could be the best pin
assignment for NEC  D 
I am going to make a completely new cable with maximum shieldings and
isolations  as soon as someone figures out how the pins should be
arranged  especially syncs and groundings 

Yes  I have checked that the monitor is not defective  it works
perfectly well with all PC graphic adapters up to     x    pixels and
also Atari   Hz monochrome  which I am using now with it 

Here are the pinouts   stuff
