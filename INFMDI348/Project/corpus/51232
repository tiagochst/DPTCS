   No  everything wouldn t be OK  but it would be a start 
  Now wait  if the religious organizations were no longer tax exempt  what
  other beef could you have   They would then have as much right to lobby
  as would any other group 
 You asked  would everything be okay    I answered no   Everything 
 encompasses more than just the tax exempt status of religious 
 organizations 

Well  if everything wouldn t be okay  then tell us what it is that
wouldn t be okay    That is  if religions were no longer tax exempt  then
what would be wrong with their lobbying or otherwise attempting to
influence politics
