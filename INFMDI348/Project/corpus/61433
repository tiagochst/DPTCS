The other week I saw a TV program about the american space industry and NASA 
It said that in the    s they developed a rocket that used ions or nuclear
particles for propolsion 
The government however  didn t give them   billion for the developement
of a full scale rocket 
Did anybody see this program 
If not  has anybody heard of the particle propolsion system 

Thanx
