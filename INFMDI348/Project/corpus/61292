  I would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for Humans 
  I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere evolve given a range
  of physical aspects of the planet   The question is what physical aspects
  simply disallow earth like conditions 
  
  eg Temperature range of    K to    K  where temp is purely dependant on dist
       from the sun and the suns temperature   
     Atmospheric presure     I know nothing of human tolerance

There are people who have adapted to high altitudes in the Andes and in
Tibet  I suspect that it took them several generations to make the
adaptation because Europeans had difficulty making the adaptation  They
had to send the women to a lower altitude when they were pregnant in order
to insure sucessful childbirth 

     Planetary Mass     again gravity at surface is important  how much
       can human bodies take day after day   Also how does the mass effect
       atmosphere   I thinking of planets between    and   times mass of the
       earth   I suppose density should be important as well 
  

Another factor you should consider is the X ray opacity of the atmosphere 
in case of stellar flares  the uv opacity is also important because uv 
radiation can kill or damage microbes  plants  and animals  

  Climate etc does not concern me  nor does axial tilt etc etc   Just the above
  three factors and how they relate to one another
