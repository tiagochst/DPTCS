 Option  A    Low Cost Modular Approach
      Human tended capability  as opposed to the old SSF sexist term
      of man tended capability  

 Option  B    Space Station Freedom Derived
      Man Tended Capability  Griffin has not yet adopted non sexist
      language  

 Option C   Single Core Launch Station 

I ll vote for anything where they don t feel constrained to use stupid
and ugly PC phrases to replace words like  manned    If they think
they need to do that  they re more than likely engaging in  politics
and public relations as usual  rather than seriously wanting to
actually get into space   So that eliminates Option  A  from the
running   What do they call a manned station in Option  C  

 I m actually about half serious about that   People should be more
concerned with grammatical correctness and actually getting a working
station than they are with  Political Correctness  of terminology
