	Again  not true  The characters in a TT or Type   font depend on the 
	maker  If someone converts a Type   font to TT they ll only get the
	characters in the font of orgin  TT allows for much more flexibility
	in this area as well  You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font
	file  Mac PS Windows Unicode char set  and use the characters
	appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on 

Well  yes  both Type   and TrueType fonts can contain lots of characters 
And in both cases plain text fonts will be reencoded to Windows ANSI
in Windows  and to Mac standard roman encoding on the Mac  
No difference there between T  and TT    

And as for fonts with thousands of glyphs  right know these are a liabiliaty
rather than a great new thing   Reason is that a font with      characters
is very large  and if you can only access     of them you are paying a heavy
price in downloading time and printer storage    And at the moment there
is only one program of that uses  partial font downloading  

	For instance  all or our fontpack   TT fonts have the Mac Windows
	char set in them  The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font
	is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac
	char set  	

Yes and T  text fonts all have the  ISO Adobe  character set  which is
a superset of Windows ANSI and Macintosh standard roman enocding 

The question is whether you can get at the glyphs   In Windows  for example 
you cannot get at the ligatures  fi  anfd  fl   both T  and TT even though a
font may very well have them 

ANd  while it is somewhat painful to reencode a Type   font and to create a
new Windows metric file  PFM  for it  there are utilities out there to allow
you do this   How do I reencode a TrueType font   How can I get at the
 fi  and  fl  ligatures in Windows  or on the Mac    Are there utilities
that make it possible to circumvent the hard wired Windows ANSI encoding
