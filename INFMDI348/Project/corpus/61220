 the  Environmental
 Billboard  is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to
    x     meters   Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area 
 deployed by the inflatable  frame  
    To help sell the concept  the spacecraft responsible for
 maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry  ozone reading
 sensors  to  continuously monitor the condition of the Earth s
 delicate protective ozone layer   according to Mike Lawson  head of
 SMI  Furthermore  the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum
 exposure of    days it will be released to re enter the Earth s
 atmosphere  According to IMI   as the biodegradable material burns 
 it will release ozone building components that will literally
 replenish the ozone layer  
                          

 Can we assume that this guy studied advertising and not chemistry   Granted 
it probably a great advertising gimic  but it doesn t sound at all practical
