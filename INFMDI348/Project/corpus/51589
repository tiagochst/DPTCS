With a little luck  I could own a C    sometime in the near future  and
so I was just wondering if someone could clear these two questions up for me 

    What speed SIMMS does the C    need want    I know that it needs   ns
VRAM   not sure for the main RAM  

    I ve heard two conflicting stories about the total expandibility of the
C    s RAM       and     megs   Which is true    Perhaps another phrasing
would be better   does the   meg version come with all   megs on the logic
board  or   megs   a   meg SIMM  

Just wondering
