 The movie version
 of  The Last Temptation of Christ  was so awful that practically no one
 would have seen it  or been influenced by its message  had not
 conservatives loudly protested its distribution   They unwittingly
 created a larger market for the movie 

In many places  Christians were sucessful in their attempts
to get the films banned  or at least given a very restrictive 
showing 

I have no problem with Christians burning their own pieces of
art  though I find it a tragic waste   I do however have a 
problem with their attempts to censor what I may or may not
view
