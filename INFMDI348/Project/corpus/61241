      REQUEST FOR IDEAS FOR APPLICATIONS OF REMOTE SENSING DATABASES 
                             VIA THE INTERNET
 
NASA is planning to expand the domain of users of its Earth and space science
data   This effort will 
 
  o   Use the evolving infrastructure of the U S  Global Change Research 
      Program including the Mission To Planet Earth  MTPE  and the Earth 
      Observing System Data and Information System  EOSDIS  Programs 
 
  o   Use the Internet  particularly the High Performance Computing and 
      Communications Program s NREN  National Research and Education 
      Network   as a means of providing access to and distribution of 
      science data and images and value added products 
 
  o   Provide broad access to and utilization of remotely sensed images in 
      cooperation with other agencies  especially NOAA  EPA  DOE  DEd  
      DOI USGS  and USDA   
 
  o   Support remote sensing image and data users and development 
      communities  
 
The user and development communities to be included  but not limited to  as
part of this effort are educators  commercial application developers  e g   
television weather forecasters   librarians  publishers  agriculture 
specialists  transportation  forestry  state and local government planners  and
aqua business 
 
This program will be initiated in        Your assistance is requested to 
identify potential applications of remote sensing images and data   We would 
like your ideas for potential application areas to assist with development of
the Implementation Plan 
 
PLEASE NOTE  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS   
 
We are seeking your ideas in these areas  
 
       Potential commercial use of remote sensing data and images  
 
       Potential noncommercial use of remote sensing data and images in 
       education  especially levels K     and other noncommercial areas 
 
       Types of on line capabilities and protocols to make the data more 
       accessible 
 
       Additional points of contacts for ideas  and 
 
       Addresses and names  from whom to request proposals  
 
For your convenience  a standard format for responses is included below   Feel
free to amend it as necessary   Either e mail or fax your responses to us by
May

REQUEST FOR IDEAS FOR APPLICATIONS OF REMOTE SENSING DATABASES VIA THE INTERNET
 
     Potential commercial use of remote sensing data and images   if possible 
identify the relevant types of data or science products  user tools  and
standards  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     Uses of remote sensing data and images in education  especially levels
K     and other noncommercial areas  if possible  identify the relevant types
of data or science products  user tools  and standards   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     Types of on line capabilities and protocols to make the data and images
more accessible  if possible  identify relevant types of formats  standards 
and user tools 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     Additional suggested persons or organizations that may be resources for 
further ideas on applications areas   Please include  Name  Organization  
Address and Telephone Number 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     Organizations  mailing lists  electronic and paper   periodicals  etc  to
whom a solicitation for proposals should be sent when developed   Please 
include  Name  Organization  Address and Telephone Number 
 
 
 
     We would benefit from knowing why users that know about NASA remote 
sensing data do not use the data   Is it because they do not have ties to NASA
investigators  or high cost  lack of accessibility  incompatible data formats 
poor area of interest coverage  inadequate spatial or spectral resolution      
 
 
 
 
 
     In case we have questions  please send us your name  address  phone number
 and e mail address if you have one    If you don t wish to send us this
information  feel free to respond to the survey anonymously   Thank you for
your assistance
