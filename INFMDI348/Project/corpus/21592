     Traditional interpretation of arsenokoitai   homosexuals   in   Cor    
and   Tim      refers to sexual vice between people of the same sex 
specifically homosexualitiy   Some restrict the term s meaning to  active male
prostititute   but stronger evidence supports a more general translation 
namely  homosexuals    More recently the definition  homosexual  has been
opposed on clutural and linguistic grounds  the claim being that the term
 homosexuals  is anachronistic   In addition  criticism of the traditional
rendering says the term today includes celibate homophiles  excludes
heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts  and includes female homosexuals  
A concern for acts instead of the modern attention to desires was the only
factor in the ancient world   The foregoing oppositition to the translation of
arsenokoitai by  homosexuals  has a number of debilitating weaknesses  
Finally  this study argues that Paul coined the term arsenokoitai  deriving it
from the LXX of Lev        cf         and using it for homosexual orientation
and behavior  the latter of which should be an occasion for church discipline
 I Cor      and legislation in society    Tim         

                                                           

                                   INTRODUCTION

     Coincident with the rise of the gay rights movement in recent years has
been an increasing focus on the biblical statements regarding homosexuality or
sodomy     As part of this focus  the meaning of the term arsenokoitai  used
twice by the apostle Paul    Cor       I Tim        has received vigorous
scrutiny     This issue is particularly crucial to contemporary society since
so much of modern ethics is shaped by biblical statements   More particularly  
the concern over gay rights and the place of gays or homosexuals in the church
and in society require the resolution of biblical interpretation 

     This study of historical  linguistic  and literary matters will survey and
evalutate recent proposals for the meaning of arsenokoitai and present evidence
to point to a resolution   Several writers and their positions represent the
modern debate on this word   Three authors  Bailey  Boswell  and Scroggs  have
provoked considerable discussion and significantly encouraged the wider
acceptance of the homosexual lifestyle in society  in the church  and in the
ministry

     For convenience sake  the term  homosexual  is used to encompass both
same sex orientation and same sex behavior   The meaning of this term is one of
the main considerations of this study 
    These times are differnt from just over a century ago   Then P Fairbairn
 Pastoral Epistles  Edinburg              could write of arsenokoitai thit it
is a  term for which fortunately our language has no proper equivalent   
Unknowingly he thereby touched upon the basis for the contemporary debate and
study   THe present writer endorses the Pauline authorship of the Pastoral
Epistles on the basis of internal and external evidence  see Donald Guthrie 
New Testament Introduction    th ed                  for an extensive
discussion and citation of supporters of the Pauline authorship  
    For example  see Scroggs  influence on M  Olson   Untangling the Web   The
Other Side  April                For a study suggesting a further prohibition
of homosexuality in the OT  see A  Phillips   Unconvering the Father s Skirt
