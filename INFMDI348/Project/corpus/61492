In article   rrgu   lp access digex net  prb access digex net  Pat  writes 
  No  the thing is designed to be retrievable  in a pinch   Indeed  this
  dictated a rather odd design for the solar arrays  since they had to be
  retractable as well as extendable   
 
 Why not design the solar arrays to be detachable   if the shuttle is going
 to retunr the HST   what bother are some arrays   

They can be detached in an emergency   But expensive hardware is not thrown
away casually  bearing in mind that nobody knew the design was defective  
If the deployment crew had found some nasty flaw    the lid failing to open 
for example    it would have been a bit embarrassing to have to throw the
solar arrays away to get the thing back in the payload bay
