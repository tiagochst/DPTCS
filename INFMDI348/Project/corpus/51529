My MacClassic mouse died   I dissected it and determined that it is
the microswitch  that senses the click  that is stuck in the depressed
mode   This tragedy prompts the following questions 

  	Is it easy to find a microswitch that I could solder into the
	place of the old switch  

  	I have old mice  Max   Mac    Ke   can they be used with some
	adapter
