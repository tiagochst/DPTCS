On Friday   May       Marty Helgesen wrote 

   Public revelation  which is the basis of Catholic doctrine  ended
   with the death of St John  the last Apostle  Nothing new can be
   added 

Every so often  the Pope declares that some departed Christian is
now in Heaven  and may be invoked in the public rites of the Church 
It is my understanding that Roman Catholics believe that such
declarations by the Pope are infallible  I see three possibilities 
        The Church has received a Public Revelation since the death
of  for example  Joan of Arc 
        The Church was given a list before the death of St John
which had Joan s name on it 
        There is no public revelation about Joan  and Roman
Catholics are free to doubt that she died in a state of grace  or
even that she is a historical character 

 Yours
