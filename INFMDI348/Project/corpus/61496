  No  the thing is designed to be retrievable  in a pinch   Indeed  this
  dictated a rather odd design for the solar arrays  since they had to be
  retractable as well as extendable  and may thus have indirectly contributed
  to the array flapping problems 


 Why not design the solar arrays to be detachable   if the shuttle is going
 to retunr the HST   what bother are some arrays   just fit them with a quick
  release   one  space walk   or use the second canadarm to remove the arrays 

You may want to put Hubble back in the payload bay for a reboost 
and you don t want to clip off the panels each time 

For the Gamma Ray Observatory  one of the design requirements was that
there be no stored energy mecahnisms  springs  explosive squibs  gas shocks 
etc   used for deployment   This was partially so that everything could
be reeled back in to put it back in the payload bay  and partially for
safety considerations    I ve heard that the wings on a cruise missile
would cut you in half if you were standing in their swath when they opened  

Back when the shuttle would be going up every other day with a cost to
orbit of       per pound      everybody designed things for easy servicing
