 Hi    what alternatives to the Express modem do Duo owners have  if
 they want to go at least      baud  

 Every place in town says they are back ordered  and part of the reason
 I want a laptop mac is so I can use it as a remote terminal from
 wherever I am  but I really would hate to have to wait   months to get
 a modem in or have to settle with      baud 

You re not going to like this  but if memory serves me  postings
I ve read in this newsgroup and elsewhere indicate that there are
no  repeat no  internal modems for the Duo besides the Express
Modem    at  any  speed   Something having to do with the modem
using the main CPU for some of its tasks  and Apple not releasing
details on the architecture  or something   I m vague on the
details  but the gist was that there are going to be no
third party internal Duo modems   If I m wrong  somebody please
correct me on this   Sorry to be the bearer of bad news 

Joel
