  I hope that anyone who remembers seeing Rev  Troy Perry s
   performance  at the      March On Washington will see for themselves
  just how inconceivable it is to mix Christianity with homosexuality 

  Whether or not Christianity and homosexuality are compatible is clearly
  debatable  since it IS being debated   In my opnion  it is genuinely
  destuctive to the cause of Christianity to use this sort of ad hominem
  argument to oppose one s adversaries   It only serves to further drive
  people away from Christianity because it projects and confirms the
  frequently held opinion that Christians are unable to think critically
  and intelligently  

I agree entirely   Speaking as an atheist  heterosexual  for what it s
worth   this is one of the least attractive parts of some varieties of
Christianity   Although I m sure it s possible to argue theologically
that we shouldn t make analogies between discrimination on the basis
of sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation 
morally the case looks unanswerable  for those outside religion   the
three forms  are  analogous  we shouldn t discriminate on the basis of
sex  race or sexual orientation 

I found the moderator s FAQs on the subject instructive  and recommend
everyone to read them 

There seem to be three different levels of acceptance 

   Regard homosexual orientation as a sin  or evil  whatever 
   Regard homosexual behaviour as a sin  but accept orientation
 though presumably orientation is unfortunate  and dislike people who
indulge
   As    but  love the sinner 
   Accept homosexuality altogether 

My experience is that   is the most common attitude  I imagine   and  
are limited to a few fundamentalist sects  

I suppose I can go along with    except that I have this feeling that
a        year old living in a community with this attitude  on
discovering that they were more attracted to members of the same sex 
would not feel the love of the community  but would rather feel the
pressure not to exhibit their feelings   I m not saying that the
community  in particular the parents  would not love the child  but I
suspect the child would not feel loved
