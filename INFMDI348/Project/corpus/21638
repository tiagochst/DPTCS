JEK cu nih gov writes 
 I wrote that the Apostle Paul  in Romans    speaks of God as
 choosing Jacob over Esau  and adds that this is not as a result of
 anything that either child had done  since they had not been born
 yet 

It s my understanding that Romans       As it is written  Jacob have I
loved  but Esau have I hated   refers not to the two individuals  but
rather to their offspring  the tribe of Jacob and the tribe of Esau

See Obadiah  for example   In fact  if you scan through the OT  you
will find similar references to the two tribes
