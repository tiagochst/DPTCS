   really going to offend and or upset you

   I assume everyone here is familiar with the Christian  fish  symbol 
   The one on the back of all those Volvos 
   The one that looks  something  like

   Well  I found out this morning where it comes from    
   
   It s been stolen from the pagans  like so much else    
   
    Last last chance to be blisfully ignorant    
   
   Hmm  how can I put it 
   
   Well  it comes from  this    
   
   
   
                      
                      
                      
                          
   
   
   
   Sigh  I hate drawing with ascii chars 
   Still  I think you can work it out from there    
 
 If you haven t  go read  Skinny Legs and All  by Tom Robbins  If he s even
     accurate then most of the modern religions have been  appropriated  
 It s also a great book

I thought it was derived from a Greek acronym   My Greek isn t up to much  but
it goes something like this 

	Jesus Christ  God    Iesus CHristos  THeos    Ichthos

which is the Greek for  fish   as in  eg  ichthysaurus   

Apologies for my dreadful Greek   Perhaps someone will correct it 

By the way  what does your sig mean
