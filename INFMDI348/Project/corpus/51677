 If you have no friends  buy a     MB optical

Huh   If I buy a    M optical  I might lose my friends   Why   do they
smell bad 

   


 and stop worrying about cartridge wear  Bernoulli  or crashes  SyQuest 

On a serious note  I have heard the tales about SyQuest failures   But I
am curious about Jon s comments on cartridge wear for the the Bernoullis 
Can someone elaborate   Is there a general consensus that the    M opticals
are the most reliable   I am mostly concerned about media failures  as
opposed to drive mechanism failures
