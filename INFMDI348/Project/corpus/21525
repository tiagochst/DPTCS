Andy Byler writes on the Biblical basis for the dogma of the
Immaculate Conception 

    I will put enmity between you  the Serpent  and the woman  and
   between your seed and her seed  she  can also be read he  shall
   crush your head and you shall bruise her  or his  heel 
    Genesis     

    He who commits sin is of the devil           John    

    Hail  full of grace  greek   kecharitomene   the Lord is with
   thee         Luke     

In the Hebrew of Genesis       the gender is clearly masculine 

   HE shall crush your head  and you shall bruise HIS heel 

The Latin has feminine forms  only by an accident of grammar 

Andrew stated that KECHARITOMENE means not just  full of grace  but
 having a plenitude or perfection of grace   The word is used
elsewhere in the New Testament only in Ephesians    

   Unto the praise of the glory of his grace  in which he hath
   GRACED us in his beloved Son   Rheims Douay translation 

I cannot find any indication in my dictionary that the verb implies
anything as strong as Andrew suggests  nor does the Ephesians
passage suggest that the verb means  to preserve from any taint of
original or actual sin from the first moment of existence   I should
like to see a comment on the meaning of the verb  preferably not
from s writer who is discussing Luke      at the moment 

 Yours
