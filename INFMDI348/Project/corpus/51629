         I cannot speak for Dale  But I am quite sure that the Macintosh 
 uses the full    bit or    bit data path to its full advantage  That is  
 it is running as fast with two or four    pin SIMMs as it would with one 
    pin SIMM  Now  it may be that longword accesses  assuming a    bit 
 data path here  get the first byte from the first SIMM  the second byte 
 from the second  and so on  This would mean that each longword of memory 
 is actually split among four SIMMs  one for each byte  On the other hand  
 it could be that the SIMMs are interleaved by word or longword  not just 
 by byte   or they could be successive in memory  and the memory 
 controller deals with the eight bit data path that each one has  I 
 suspect  though  that they are interleaved to some extent so that    bits 
 can be read or written at once  This would indicate a byte level 
 interleave 
         I am NOT confusing this with the new machines  longword 
 interleave with two    pin SIMMs of the same sort  although that seems to 
 be the same sort of idea  There  you get an essential    bit data path ro 
  excuse me  to  RAM instead of just a    bit one  Yes  the CPU can t 
 handle it  but when writing to successive addresses it speeds something 
 up 
         So  Dale  am I right     pin SIMMs are interleaved by bytes  
 allowing the full data bus  Or  as is common with Usenet and me in 
 particular  am I as clueless as everyone else 

What conclusion can be drawn from this   I m trying to figure out what kind
of memory configuration for the LC III     bit datapath  would be fastest   Any
ideas 

Thanks
