     Yes  you get internal mixing of the analog CD Audio outputs with
     the Mac generated audio on the Mac motherboard   Also you can sample
     the CD Audio using the sound control panel by clicking on the Options
     button next to the microphone icon 
    How do you click on the Options button   I ve never seen it undimmed 
  
       The latest word on this is you have to disconnect the Microphone
   cable on the motherboard  Then the button is supposed to un dim 

The audio will simply select the CD audio when the microphone is removed  
I don t believe the button un dims  since there s nothing to select   I
haven t tracked down a Centris to check this on though 

  Sorry  I assumed that the the various new machines with the internal
  CD ROM bay worked the same as the Quadra       Obviously they don t 

Yup  I made the same mistake several months ago when this issue came up
before
