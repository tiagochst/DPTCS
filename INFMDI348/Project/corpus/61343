 My guess is  why  bother with  usingthe shuttle to reboost 
 
 why not  grapple   do all said fixes    bolt a small  liquid  fueled
 thruster module  to  HST    then let it make the re boost   it has to be
 cheaper on mass then usingthe shuttle as a tug    that way  now that
 they are going to need at least    spacewalks   then they can carry
 an EDO pallet   and  sit on station and even  maybe do the  solar array
 tilt  motor  fix 
 

	As Herny pointed out  you have to develop the thruster 
Also  while much lighter  you still have to lift the mass of
the thruster to orbit  and then the thruster lifts its own 
weight into a higher orbit   And you take up room in the payload
bay
