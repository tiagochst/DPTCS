  My syllogism is of the form 
  A is B 
  C is A 
  Therefore C is B 
  
  This is a logically valid construction 
  
  Your syllogism  however  is of the form 
  A is B 
  C is B 
  Therefore C is A 
  
  Therefore yours is a logically invalid construction  
  and your comments don t apply 

If all of those are  is  s of identity  both syllogisms are valid 
If  however  B is a predicate  then the second syllogism is invalid 
 The first syllogism  as you have pointed out  is valid  whether B
is a predicate or designates an individual
