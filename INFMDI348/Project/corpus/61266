   From   Phil G  Fraering   pgf srl   cacs usl edu 
     Finally  this isn t the Bronze Age      
     please try to remember that there are more human activities than
     those practiced by the Warrior Caste  the Farming Caste  and the
     Priesthood 

F Baube responds 
   Right  the Profiting Caste is blessed by God  and may
    freely blare its presence in the evening twilight   

  Steinn Sez 
   The Priesthood has never quite forgiven
   the merchants  aka Profiting Caste  sic  
   for their rise to power  has it 

If we are looking for evidence of belessed by God ness  I d say the ability
to blare lights all over the evening sky is about the best evidence you
could ever hope to get   No wonder the preistly classes are upset
