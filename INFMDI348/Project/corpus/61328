see the Russian Space Station Mir which will be visible every EVENING  some
time between   o clock and midnight  from April    to May    It s about as
bright as Jupiter at its best  There are two cosmonuats on board 

For the time to watch  tel                   p min peak   p min all other
times  but prediction is at start of the weekly message so it only costs a
few pence

few seconds accuracy if possible  when it passes ABOVE or BELOW any bright
