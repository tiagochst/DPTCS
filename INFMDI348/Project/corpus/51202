   But could you give a definition of free will  Especially in the
   presence of an omniscient being 

  Will  is  self determination    In other words  God created conscious
 beings who have the ability to choose between moral choices independently
 of God   All  will   therefore  is  free will  

So these hypothetical conscious beings can ignore any influences of
their circumstances  their genetics  their environment  their experiences 
which are not all self determined 

 Of course  the idea of Hell makes the idea of  free will  dubious 
On the other hand  the idea of Hell is not a very powerful idea 

	 A Parable for You

	 There was once our main character who blah blah blah 
	 One day  a thug pointed a mean looking gun at OMC  and
said   Do what I say  or I m blasting you to hell  
	 OMC thought   If I believe this thug  and follow the
instructions that will be given  I ll avoid getting blasted to
hell   On the other hand  if I believe this thug  and do not
follow the instructions that will be given  I ll get blasted to
hell   Hmm    the more attractive choice is obvious  I ll
follow the instructions    Now  OMC found the choice obvious
because everything OMC had learned about getting blasted to
hell made it appear very undesirable 
	 But then OMC noticed that the thug s gun wasn t a real
gun   The thug s threats were make believe 
	 So OMC ignored the thug and resumed blah blah blah
