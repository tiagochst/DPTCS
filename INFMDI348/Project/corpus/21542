In article  May                        athos rutgers edu  dan ingres com  a Rose arose  writes 

    were God to call me to be a prophet and I were to misrepresent God s Word 
    my calling would be lost forever   God s Word would command the people
    never to listen to or fear my words as I would be a false prophet   My
    bridges would be burnt forever   Perhaps I could repent and be saved  but
    I could never again be a prophet of God 

Though there is a command in the law not to heed to one who prophecies 
falsely  it is still possible for the one who has prophecied falsely
to prophecy truely again   Take  for example the story in Kings about the
man of God from Judah who came to israel and prophecied against a king 
The Lord had commanded him to not eat or drink till he returned home 
Another prophet wanted this man of God to stay in his house  so he
prophecied falsely that the Lord wanted the man of God to stay in his 
house   While they ate and drank in his house  the Lord gave the prophet
who lied a word that the man of God would die from breaking the word of
the Lord   It came to pass
