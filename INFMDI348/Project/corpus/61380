 I understand the when one is in orbit  the inward force of gravity at
one s center of mass is exactly balanced by the outward centrifugal
force from the orbiting motion  resulting in weightlessness 

 I want to know what weightlessness actually FEELS like  For example  is
there a constant sensation of falling  And what is the motion sickness
that some astronauts occasionally experience  

 Please reply only if you are either a former or current astronaut  or 
someone who has had this discussion first hand with an astronaut  
Thanks
