   an image of the moon has been caught in a weather satellite images of the earth 
   it appears in both the          UT ir and visual images of the earth 
   the GIF images can be down loaded from vmd cso uiuc edu and are named
   CI       GIF and CV       GIF for the IR and visual images respectively 
   
   pretty cool pictures   in the ir it s saturated but in the visual image
   details on the moon are viewable 
  
  Near midsummer  you can see the relfection of the Sun in the ocean 
  Also during solar eclise you can see the shadow of the sun move
  across the clouds 

Speaking of which  a paper was out a few years ago about a
weather sat imaging a lunar eclipse    are those images
uploaded anywhere   I could dig out the reference if there s interest
