 Ijust got a new Datadesk    E keyboard to go with my new Centris     and have a
 problem doing desktop rebuilds   I hold down the Command and Option keys and
 restart but nothing happens   The DIP switches are set the right way and the
 Command and Option keys seem to work on anything else   I m running     btw 
 Anyone know what the problem is 
  Terry


I am resending this message because my news program may have goofed the first
time 

Terry  I recently bought an LCIII and a Datadesk    E  I don t
remember trying to rebuild the desktop with it  however it did give me
a strange problem   When I held down shift during startup to disable
all extensions  nothing happened  I tried it with another keyboard  using
the same adb connector cable  and it worked with the other keyboard 
The shift key on the Datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise  I checked
the dipswitches and they are fine   Try disabling your extensions and tell
me if it works 
             
I am annoyed with Datadesk   I sent them the keyboard in the mail for
inspection repair replacement   The technician on the phone said they
have a       day turn around time  meaning you should receive the
inspected repaired keyboard in that time   Well  they have had the          
keyboard for over   weeks and I still have gotten very little info
from them about it  It s annoying because it cost me     to send them
the keyboard and their technical support line is not toll free  tell me
if you have a similar experience with them
