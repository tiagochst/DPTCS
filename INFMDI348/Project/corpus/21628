In article  May                       athos rutgers edu  mdw      uxa cso uiuc edu  Michael D  Walker  writes 

 	My feeling on baptism is this   parents baptize their baby so that the
 	baby has the sanctifying grace of baptism  and thus removal of original
 	sin  on its soul in the event of an unexpected death 

You are right  Michael 

In John      Jesus says   Amen  amen  I say to you  no one can enter the
kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit    That s really what
He said  and He meant it   That verse is the definition of baptism   I don t
have the law book in front of me  but there is a canon law that urges
parents to baptize their children within one week of birth for the very
reason that you state
