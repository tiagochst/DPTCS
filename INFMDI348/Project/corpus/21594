  I don t necessarily object to the secrecy but I do question it  since I see  
no 
  Biblical reason why any aspect of Christian worship should involve secrecy   
  But I am interested in your claim that early Christian practices  parallel  
  Mormon temple ceremonies   Could you give an example   Also  why do they only 
  parallel Mormon ceremonies   Why don t Mormon ceremonies restore the original 
  Christian practices   Wasn t that the whole point of Joseph Smith s stated 
  mission 
  

I d recommend reading  Mormonism and Early Christianity  by Hugh Nibley   
particularly the articles on Christ s forty day  post resurrection  mission   
baptism for the dead  early Christian prayer circles  and temples    articles
