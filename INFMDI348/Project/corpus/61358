I have often thought about  if its possible to have a powerfull laser
on earth  to light at the Moon  and show lasergraphics at the surface
so clearly that you can see it with your eyes when there is a new
moon 

How about a Coca Cola logo at the moon  easy way to target billions of
people 

Do you know if its possible
