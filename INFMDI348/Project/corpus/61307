   I didn t want to quote all the stuff that s been said recently  I
just wanted to add a point 

   The whole question of  a right to a dark sky  revolves around the
definition of a right   Moral rights and natural rights are all well and
good  but as far as I can see  a right is whatever you or someone
representing you can enforce   In most civilizations  the government or
the church  or both  defines what the rights of the citizens are  and
then enforces those rights for them   Here in the U S   the constitution
provides a  Bill of Rights  from which most if not all legal rights are
considered to derive   I m sure that most other countries have
comparable documents   If you can persuade a court that you have a right
to a dark sky derived in some manner from the Bill of Rights  in the
U S    you can prevent  maybe  these billboards from being launched   To
keep anyone in the world from launching then gets into international law
and the International Court of Justice  correct name   in the Hague 
something I know little about
