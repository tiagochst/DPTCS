       I have a question about Satan   I was taught a long time ago
  that Satan was really an angel of God and was kicked out of heaven
  because he challenged God s authority   The problem is  I cannot
  find this in the Bible   Is it in the Bible   If not  where did it
  originate 

 	The quick answer   Revelation       


And as someone mentioned earlier  from the apocryphal Book of Enoch 
satan was apparently kicked out for three times asserting his own will 
 I will    Hmmm   pro choice looks kinda creepy here 

Then there are the references around the Bible about taking a third
of the angels  getting a third of the heavens or something
