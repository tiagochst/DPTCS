                                     PART

        To the North Pole 

        On June   and          two of the Soviet Union s mighty PROTON 
    rockets lifted off from the Tyuratam Space Center in the Kazakhstan 
    Republic   Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe 
    for the planet Venus  

        Designated VENERA    and     the probes were meant not for landing
    yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the
    planet in detail from orbit   To accomplish this task  the basic
    VENERA design was modified in numerous areas   The central bus core
    was made one meter        inches  longer to carry the two tons of
    propellant required for braking into orbit  double the fuel carried by
    the VENERA   and    orbiters eight years earlier   Extra solar panels
    were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large
    amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging   The
    dish shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger 
    to properly transmit this information to Earth  

        Atop the buses  where landers were usually placed  were installed
    the     by   meter       by      foot       kilogram      pound 
    POLYUS V side looking radar antennae   The radar system  possibly a
    terrain imaging version of the nuclear powered satellites used by 
    the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance  would be able to map Venus 
    surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers       to     miles   

        The Soviet probes  imaging parameters were a vast improvement over
    the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter  which could reveal objects 
    no smaller than    kilometers     miles  in diameter   And while the
    VENERAs  resolution was comparable to that of similar observations 
    made by the     meter        foot  Arecibo radio telescope on the 
    island of Puerto Rico  the orbiters would be examining the northern
    pole of Venus   This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or 
    PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially 
    interesting geological features worthy of investigation 

        On October           after an interplanetary journey of     
    million kilometers      million miles  and two mid course corrections  
    VENERA    fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a 
    polar orbit       by        kilometers      by        miles  around 
    the planet  completing one revolution every twenty four hours   VENERA 
       followed suit four days later   The twin probes thus became Venus  
    first polar circling spacecraft 

        Radar operations began on October    for VENERA    and October    
    for VENERA      For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north
    pole  the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface     kilometers 
     ninety miles  wide and nine thousand kilometers        miles  long   
    The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over 
    the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back 
    to two large Soviet antennae on Earth   Each strip of information took 
    eight hours to process by computer   By the end of their main missions 
    in July of       the VENERAs had mapped     million square kilometers 
        million square miles   thirty percent of the entire planet 

        VENERA    and    revealed that Venus has a surface geology more
    complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late     s   Numerous hills  
    mountains  ridges  valleys  and plains spread across the landscape  
    many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the 
    last one billion years   In planetary terms this makes the Venerean 
    surface rather young   Hundreds of craters were detected as well  the 
    largest of which had to have been created by meteorites  planetoids 
    would be a better term here  at least fourteen kilometers      miles  
    across  due to Venus  very dense atmosphere 

        There were some disagreements between U S  and Soviet scientists
    on the origins of certain surface features   For example  the probes  
    owners declared that the    kilometer       mile  wide crater at the 
    summit of        meter         foot  high Maxwell Montes  the tallest 
    mountain on the planet  was the result of a meteorite impact   American 
    scientists  on the other hand  felt the crater was proof that Maxwell 
    was a huge volcano sitting on the northern  continent  of Ishtar Terra   

        In any event  the U S  decided to wait on making verdicts about
    Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe  scheduled for later
    in the decade   Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar
     VOIR   its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig 
    nated the Venus Radar Mapper  VRM    Eventually the machine would be 
    called MAGELLAN  after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan 
     circa              This vehicle would map the entire planet in even 
    finer detail than the VENERAs   For the time  however  the Soviet 
    probes maintained that distinction 

        Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs   Bolted
    next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the 
    Fourier infrared spectrometer  the latter for measuring the world s
    temperatures   The majority of the areas covered registered about
    five hundred degrees Celsius      degrees Fahrenheit   but a few
    locations were two hundred degrees hotter  possibly indicating 
    current volcanic activity   The probes also found that the clouds 
    over the poles were five to eight kilometers  three to     miles  
    lower than at the equator   In contrast  the polar air above sixty 
    kilometers  thirty six miles  altitude was five to twenty degrees 
    warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights 

        When the main mapping mission ended in July of       there were 
    plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at 
    more southernly latitudes   Unfortunately this idea did not come to 
    pass  as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude control
    gas to perform the operation   

        VENERA    and    ceased transmission in March of       leaving 
    the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six 
    hundred kilometers      miles  of radar data tape to sort into an 
    atlas of twenty seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus 

        Venus by Balloon

        For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting 
    target to scientists who wished to explore the planet s mantle of 
    air with balloon borne instruments   Professor Jacques Blamont of 
    the French space agency Centre National d Etudes Spatiales  CNES 
    had proposed such an idea as far back as       only to have a joint 
    French Soviet balloon mission canceled in        Nevertheless  
    late in the year       such dreams would eventually come true 

        When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December    and     
    the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear  full 
    views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe 
    since        This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission 

        The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named
    VEGA   and    a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI   Gallei
    being the Russian word for Halley   Not only did the spacecraft 
    have more than one mission to perform  they also had more than one 
    celestial objective to explore  namely the comet Halley   

        This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to 
    the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in      
    Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from
    the formation of the solar system five billion years ago  scientists 
    around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such 
    bodies which actually come close to Earth   

        Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar 
    system   Some  like Halley  are perturbed by various forces and fall 
    in towards the Sun  where they circle for millennia spewing out ice 
    and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar 
    encounter 

        The Soviet Union  along with the European Space Agency  ESA  and
    Japan s Institute of Space and Astronautical Science  ISAS   did not
    wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a
    close examination of Halley   The ESA would be using the cylindrical
    GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the 
    comet  while Japan s first deep space craft   SAKIGAKE  Pioneer  and 
    SUISEI  Comet    would view Halley from a much safer distance  

        Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet
    from the vantage of a space probe  at one time envisioning a vessel
    powered by solar sails or ion engines   However  government budget
    cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts   The U S  would have to
    make do primarily with Earth based observations and the sharing of 
    data from other nations  though an instrument named the Dust Counter 
    and Mass Analyzer  DUCMA   designed by Chicago University Professor 
    John Simpson  was added on the Soviet mission in May of      

        The Soviets  answer to Halley were the VEGAs   Instead of building
    an entirely new craft for the mission  the Soviets decided to modify
    their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an 
    advanced Venus mission along the way   As VEGA   and   reached Venus 
    the buses would drop off one lander balloon each and use the mass of 
    the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley  much as the 
    U S  probe MARINER    used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier  
    The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley  helping to pinpoint the 
    location of the comet s erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive 
    in only     kilometers      miles  away in March of      

        As planned  the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of        VEGA
      released its payload first on the ninth day of the month  the lander
    making a two day descent towards the planet   The craft touched the
    upper atmosphere on the morning of June      Sixty one kilometers
          miles  above the Venerean surface a small container was released
    by the lander  which produced a parachute at    kilometers     miles 
    altitude   Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had
    successfully arrived  

        One kilometer after the opening of the parachute  helium gas was
    pumped into the Teflon coated plastic balloon  inflating it to a
    diameter of      meters        feet    Dangling on a tether thirteen
    meters       feet  below was the instrument package  properly known as
    an aerostat   The top part of the     kilogram        pound  aerostat
    consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment
    point to the balloon   Beneath it was the transmitter  electronics 
    and instruments   Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for
    measuring cloud particles   The aerostat was painted with a special
    white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which
    permeated the planet s atmosphere  

        The VEGA   balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just
    north of the equator   Scientists were concerned that the gas bag 
    would burst in the heat of daylight  so they placed it in the darkened 
    hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data   
    This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as 
    well  effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions   
    The author wonders  though  if they could have used floodlights similar 
    to the ones attached to VENERA   and    in       when Soviet scientists 
    had thought the planet s surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight 
    due to the permanently thick cloud cover 

        The first balloon transmitted for      hours right into the day
    hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed  covering       
    kilometers        miles    The threat of bursting in the day heat did
    not materialize   The VEGA   balloon was stationed at a    kilometer
          mile  altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers
     thirty miles   for this was considered the most active of the three
    main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in        Indeed the
    balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to     kilometers
         miles  per hour   Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and
    down two to three hundred meters      to     feet  through most of the
    journey   The layer s air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius
         degrees Fahrenheit  and pressure was a mere     Earth atmosphere 
    The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds  

        Early in the first balloon s flight  the VEGA   lander was already
    headed towards the Venerean surface   Both landers were equipped with
    a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA    
    and    in        However  VEGA   would become unable to report the
    composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia  the
    Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra   While still ten to fifteen
    minutes away from landing  a timer malfunction caused the drill to 
    accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers      
    miles  above the surface  

        There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before
    touchdown nor reactivate it after landing   This was unfortunate not
    only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of
    Venus was covered with such smooth low level lava plains and had never 
    before been directly examined   Nevertheless  the surface temperature 
    and pressure was calculated at     degrees Celsius        degrees 
    Fahrenheit  and    Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander s 
       minutes of ground transmissions   A large amount of background 
    infrared radiation was also recorded at the site 

        As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA    and 
       had failed in December of       the Soviets focused on the data
    returned during the lander s plunge through the atmosphere   The
    French Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur  chlorine  
    and possibly phosphorus   It is the sulfur   possibly from active 
    volcanoes   which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color 
    The Sigma   gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air
    between an altitude of    and    kilometers       and      miles 
    contained one milligram        grain  of sulfuric acid 

        The VEGA   data on the overall structure of the cloud decks 
    appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS 
    The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA   s results
    nearly matched its twin   The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers 
    instead of the three reported by the U S  probes   The layers were 
    three to five kilometers      to   miles  thick at altitudes of    
    and    kilometers     and      miles    The clouds persisted like a
    thin fog until clearing at an altitude of    kilometers     miles   
    much lower than the PV readings   One possibility for the discrepan 
    cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air 
    over the last seven years 

        When the lander and balloon finally went silent  the last 
    functioning part of the VEGA   mission  the flyby bus  sailed on
    for a     million kilometer        million mile  journey around
    the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley   On March
             the bus made a       kilometer        mile  pass at the 
    dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space 
    The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial
    bodies with one space vessel 

        On June     VEGA   released its lander balloon payload for
    a two day fall towards Venus   Like its duplicate  the VEGA  
    balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking
    it on Earth for      hours before battery failure on the morning
    side of the planet   During its        kilometer        mile 
    flight over Venus  the second balloon entered in a rather still
    environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission 
    After    hours mission time the air became even more turbulent 
    for a further eight hours   When the balloon passed over a five 
    kilometer  three mile  mountain on the  continent  of Aphrodite 
    Terra  a powerful downdraft pulled the craft     kilometers      
    miles  towards the surface 

        Temperature sensors on the VEGA   balloon reported that the air 
    layer it was moving through was consistently     degrees Celsius 
          degrees Fahrenheit  cooler than the area explored by the VEGA  
    balloon   This was corroborated by the VEGA   lander as it passed 
    through the balloon s level   No positive indications of lightning
    were made by either balloon  and the second aerostat s nephelometer 
    failed to function 

        The VEGA   lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite
    Terra s western arm on the fifteenth of June        kilometers     
    miles  southeast of VEGA     The lander s resting place was smoother
    than thought  indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a
    relatively young one covered in fresh lava   The soil drill was in
    working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite troctolite  
    rare on Earth but present in Luna s highlands   This rock is rich in 
    aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium   A high degree 
    of sulfur was also present in the soil   The air around VEGA   measured 
        degrees Celsius        degrees Fahrenheit  and    Earth atmospheres 
    essentially a typical day  or night  on Venus 

        Far above the VEGA   lander  its carrier bus sped past Venus at
    a distance of        kilometers         miles  and followed its twin 
    to comet Halley  making a closer flyby on March         at just       
    kilometers        miles    Both probes helped to reveal that the comet 
    is a very dark and irregular shaped mass about fourteen kilometers 
         miles  across  rotating once every    hours  give or take three 
    hours 

        Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley
    encounters  Soviet scientists considered an option to send the 
    probes to other celestial objects   One prime target was the near 
    Earth planetoid      Adonis  which VEGA   could pass at a distance 
    of six million kilometers      million miles    Sadly  the Soviets 
    had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly 
    a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was 
    not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned   
    VEGA   and   were quietly shut down in early      

        Future Plans Diverted

        The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous 
    ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second 
    world from the Sun   One example was the VESTA mission  planned for
    the early     s 

        This Soviet French collaboration called for the launch of multiple 
    probes on a single PROTON rocket in either      or        The craft 
    would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon 
    probes   The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet s 
    corrosive atmosphere for up to one month  a large improvement over 
    the VEGA balloons  two days   The mission would then head out to 
    investigate several planetoids and comets  including a possible 
    landing on Vesta  thus the mission name   the most reflective Main 
    Belt planetoid as seen from Earth 

        Unfortunately for Venus exploration  plans began to change in
    the Soviet Union   In      the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA
    mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus  keeping the comet
    and planetoid aspects intact   By this time in the Soviet space 
    program interest was focusing on Mars   Already under construction 
    was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS   Two members of this 
    class were planned to leave Earth in      and orbit Mars the next 
    year   PHOBOS   and   would then place the first instruments on
    Mars  largest moon  Phobos  

        All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions 
    including balloon probes  rovers  soil sample return craft  and 
    eventually human explorers in the early Twenty First Century 
    The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious
    consideration of human colonization in the near future 

        But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars
    exploration   Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions 
    one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in      and the other
    going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon
    landing in March of       

        In      a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to
    ten penetrators around the planet in        Several years later the
    mission launch date was moved to the year      and has now been put 
    on indefinite hold   No other official Soviet missions to Venus have
    since been put forth  a sad commentary after twenty five years of
    continuous robotic exploration of the planet  

        During the late     s a drastic political and economic change
    was taking over the Soviet Union   President Mikhail Gorbachev began 
    to  open up  his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with 
    the rest of the nations  particularly those in the West   While the 
    culture became less oppressive than in the past  the economy was taking 
    a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a  free market  

        These effects hit everywhere  including the space program 
    Missions at all levels were cut back   The Soviets began making
    almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space faring
    nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to 
    make money   

        In early      it was reported that the Soviets were offering for 
    sale several fully equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price 
    of     million dollars each  an incredibly low price for any planetary 
    probe   No nation took them up on the bargain   Meanwhile the United 
    States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own 

        MAGELLAN and GALILEO 

        The U S  reactivated their long dormant planetary exploration
    with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May         
    Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft  a combination of
    spare parts from other U S  probes designed to make the most 
    detailed and complete radar mapping of Venus in history   When
    MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of       it would be
    able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of    
    meters      feet   surpassing the abilities of VENERA    and    

        In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space 
    Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit 
    the giant planet Jupiter in        On October           the Shuttle 
    ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space  
    named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the 
    probe s primary target s major moons in      

        In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on
    a direct flight to the Jovian planet  the probe was sent around
    Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach
    Jupiter   As a result  Venus became GALILEO s first planetary
    goal in February of        The probe radioed back images of the
    planet s swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in
    that violent atmosphere 

        On the Drawing Boards

        With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years 
    new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus   Scien 
    tists in the U S  have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet 
    Union   now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January    
           of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions 
    within in the next decade   Japan  India  and the ESA have also
    considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades 

        In February of      NASA came up with several new Venus projects 
    as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes
    throughout the solar system   For Venus two missions were selected
    for further study   A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing
    of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds  air
    temperature  and pressure  and the Venus Composition Probe  designed
    to study Venus  atmosphere while descending through the thick air
    with the aid of a parachute  much as the Soviets had done since      
    Final project decisions will be made in      

        Humans on Venus      

        Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus 
    At present the lead melting temperatures and crushing air pressure
    would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something
    even tougher than a VENERA lander   Plans have been looked into
    changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like
    Earth s   However  it should be noted that any such undertaking
    will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide 
    atmosphere  a major reduction in surface heat  and the ability 
    to speed up the planet s rotation rate to something a bit faster
    than once every     Earth days   Such a project may take centuries
    if not millennia 

        In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand
    Venus as its exists today   We still have yet to fully know how
    a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became
    instead such a deadly place   Will Earth ever suffer this fate 
    Perhaps Venus holds the answers   Such answers may best be found
    through international cooperation  including the nation which 
    made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus
