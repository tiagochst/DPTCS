      Also  as implied by other posters  why 
  do you need to boost the orbit on this mission anyway     
 You don t  need  to  but it s desirable   HST  like all satellites in
 low Earth orbit  is gradually losing altitude due to air drag   It was
 deployed in the highest orbit the shuttle could reach  for that reason 
 It needs occasional reboosting or it will eventually reenter    It has
 no propulsion system of its own  

Has any thought been given as to how they are going to boost the HST yet 
Give it a push   I can see the push start cartoons now
