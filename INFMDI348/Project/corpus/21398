In article  May                       athos rutgers edu  danc procom com  Daniel Cossack  writes 
 JEK cu nih gov writes 
  The Apostle Paul  Romans       points out that God chose Jacob
  rather than Esau    If we admit the possibility that they had lived previous
  lives  and that  in accordance with the Asiatic idea of  karma  
 
 And following Romans to        As it is written  Jacob have I loved 
 but Esau have I hated    How could God have loved and hated  in the
 past tense  those that are not yet born  neither having done good
 or evil 

Woah   The context is about God s calling out a special people  the Jews  to
carry the  promise    To read the meaning as literal people is to miss Paul s
entire point   I d be glad to send anyone more detailed explanations of this
passage if interested
