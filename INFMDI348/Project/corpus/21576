 In article  May                       athos rutgers edu   Eugene Bigelow ebay sun com   Geno   writes 
        Nothing unclean shall enter  heaven    Rev          Therefore 
   babies are born in such a state that should they die  they are cuf off
   from God and put in hell  which is exactly the doctrine of St  Augustine
   and St  Thomas

Regarding the first paragraph  I would say that I didn t write it  I
don t believe that unbaptized babies are put in Hell  I don t even
believe in Hell  At least  I don t believe in a fiery place where
there will be  gnashing of teeth
