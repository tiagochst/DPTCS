I m wondering if anyone knows the answer to a rather trivial question which
I ve been thinking about  What was the process used to divide the Bible into
verses  I believe Jerome divided the New Testament  but I ve never seen any
discussion of  how  he did this  It seems rather arbitrary  as opposed to  for
example  making each sentence a verse
