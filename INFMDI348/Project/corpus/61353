I am taking a course entitled  Exploring Science Using Internet  
For our final project  we are to find a compendium of Internet resources 
dealing with a science related topic  I chose Astronomy  Anyway  I was 
wondering if anyone out there knew of any interesting resources on Internet
that provide information on Astronomy  space  NASA  or anything like that
