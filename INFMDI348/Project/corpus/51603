Could someone please do one of the following 
   Point to an init that allows me to turn off power management on my
   Duo     
   Write an init that would allow me to turn off ALL power management on
   Duo     
   Point me to documentation on power management so that I can write such
   an init 
   Explain to me why such an init is totally or partially impossible 

Ideally  of course  I would like to be able to turn in on and off on the
fly 

Surely such an init would be very helpful to Powerbook owners who want to
do MIDI    I cannot imagine why it is not possible to do  unless it requires
Apple to divluge some secret  And if that is the case  the surely APPLE
could write the init   Unless Apple brings out new models so fast these
days that even THEY don t know how they work
