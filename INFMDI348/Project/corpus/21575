 bible verses ag   used ag  homosexuality deleted 

 Anyone who thinks being gay and Christianity are not compatible should 
 check out Dignity  Integrity  More Light Presbyterian churches  Affirmation 
 MCC churches  etc   Meet some gay Christians  find out who they are  pray
 with them  discuss scripture with them  and only  then  form your opinion 

also check out the episcopal church    although by no means all
episcopalians are sympathetic to homosexual men and women  there
certainly is a fairly large percentage  in my experience  who are   i
am good friends with an episcopalian minister who is ordained and
living in a monogamous homosexual relationship   this in no way
diminishes his ability to minister    in fact he has a very
significant ministry with the gay and lesbian association of his
community  as well as a very significant aids ministry 

my uncle is gay and when i found this out i had a good long think
about what the bible has to say about this and what i feel God thinks
about this   obviously my conclusions may be wrong  nonetheless they
are my own and they feel right to me   i believe that the one
important thing that those who wrote the old and new testament
passages cited above did NOT know was that there is scientific
evidence to support that homosexuality is at least partly  inherent 
rather than completely learned   this means that to a certain extent
   or to a great extent    homosexuals cannot choose how to feel about
other people    which is why reports of  curing  homosexuals always
chill me and make me feel ill   please not that  although i can t cite
sources where you can find this information  there is homosexual
behavior recorded among monkeys and other animals  which is in itself
suggestive that it is inherent rather than learned  or at least that
the word  unnatural  shouldn t really apply    

please remember that whatever you believe  gays and lesbians shoul not
be excluded from your love and acceptance   christ loved us all  and
we ALL sin   and he himself never said anything against homosexuals   
rather it is paul  who also came out with such wonderful wisdom as
 women shouldn t speak in church  and  women should keep their heads
covered in church     not exact quotations as i don t have my bible
handy  who says these things   i have a tendency to take some of the
things paul says with a grain of salt    

well  that s all i ll say for now
