This has troubled me for a long time and needs to be dealt with 

From a long article Available through an individual on this newsgroup 

About scripture being against homosexuality 
                                          
When we  are
less homophobic we will see that what we know as gay and lesbian  people 
engaging in loving  voluntary erotic relations with each other  aren t  even
mentioned   in the Bible  tk 
                                          

This frightens me  not in the homophobic sense  but intellectually  
especially because it was written by someone from a homosexual church 

So  if my interpretation is different than theirs  I am homophobic   This
can t be right  Disagreement in interpretation of the Bible and or rejection
of homosexual acts is not tantamount of homophobia
