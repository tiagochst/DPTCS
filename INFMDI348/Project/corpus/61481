  After all the space walking   they are going to  re boost the HST s
  orbit   I think right now  it s sitting  at     miles up 
  they would like        I don t know the exact orbit numbers 

As Ben says   this re boost idea is all news to us here   Do you know 
something we don t   Please supply a source   it would be nice for 
the schedulers of observations to know where the thing is going to 
be   These altitude numbers are also way off   

My best source has  
 Minimum ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is         Kilometers 
 Maximum ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is         Kilometers 
 Delta   ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is         Kilometers  

 PMDB is Proposal Management Data Base   used to schedule observations   
  

  In order to perform the re boost of the HST  the OMS engines
  will be fired for a long period   Now the shuttle is a heavy
  thing   THe HST isn t light either   THe amount of OMS fuel
  needed to fly both up is substantial    a small booster
  carried up and used to boost HST on it s own will weigh significantly
  less then the OMS fuel required to Boost  both HST and SHUttle 
  for a given orbital change   
  

Could you supply some calculations   You might check some recent 
postings that explained that  a small booster  as suggested does 
not now exist  so comparing the mass of something that doesn t 
exist to the mass of the OMS fuel seems impossible   The contamination 
threat also remains   

   
  
  or the HST could even get placed into  some sort of medium orbit 
  The reason they want a high orbit  is less antenna pointing 
  and longer drag life 
  
  Longer drag life I can understand  but could you explain the 
antenna pointing   

  Whatever it is   the problem in the tilt array is a big constraint
  on HST ops 

Tell me about it   Although the arrays can be  and are  moved perfectly 
well utilizing the second electronics box   Getting them both working 
is much desireable so as to reclaim redundancy

I don t mean to jump on you   helpful suggestions are always welcome 
and we all know the more ideas the better  but I do want the true 
situation to be described clearly and correctly  lest some get 
confused

Wm  Hathaway
