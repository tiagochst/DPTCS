In article  May                       geneva rutgers edu  noye midway uchicago edu writes 

        i believe that the one
 important thing that those who wrote the old and new testament
 passages cited above did NOT know was that there is scientific
 evidence to support that homosexuality is at least partly  inherent 
 rather than completely learned   this means that to a certain extent
    or to a great extent    homosexuals cannot choose how to feel      

But one of the most basic concepts of Christian morality is that we
all have defective appetites due to original sin   Not just
homosexuals  but everybody   Thus we are not entitled to indulge in
whatever behavior our bodies want us to 

I think we need to keep clear the distinction between homosexual
 behavior   which is wrong  and homosexual  orientation   which is not
a sin  merely a misfortune
