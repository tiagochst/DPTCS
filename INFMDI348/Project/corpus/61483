I just wanted to point out  that Teflon wasn t from the space program 
It was from the WWII nuclear weapons development program   Pipes in the 
system for fractioning and enriching uranium had to be lined with it 

Uranium Hexafloride was the chemical they turned the pitchblend into for
enrichment   It is massively corrosive   Even to Stainless steels  Hence
the need for a very inert substaance to line the pipes with   Teflon has
all its molecular sockets bound up already  so it is very unreactive 

My   sense worth 

Bill
