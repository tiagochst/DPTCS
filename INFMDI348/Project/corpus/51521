I recently purchased a Centris     and am having difficulty getting
my computer to recognize my hard disk drive  external  Using both the
disk uitily of TMS  Diskwriter  and Jasmine s software  neither one
will show the drive   The drive is the only device connected to the 
scuzzi port  I cant find the manual to the tms pro     and seem to
remember that it is  terminated    Is there something else that I am
doing  or not doing  that does not allow my     to recognize my external
disk drive  

thanks in advance for the information
