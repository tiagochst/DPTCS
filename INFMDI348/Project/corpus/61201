 If not for the lack of extraneously capitalized words  I d swear that
 McElwaine had changed his name and moved to Cal Poly   I also find the
 choice of newsgroups  interesting    Perhaps someone should tell this
 guy that  sci astro  doesn t stand for  astrology  
 
 It s truly frightening that posts like this are originating at what
 are ostensibly centers of higher learning in this country   Small
 wonder that the rest of the world thinks we re all nuts and that we
 have the problems that we do 
 
  In case you haven t gotten it yet  David  I don t think this was
 quite appropriate for a posting to  sci  groups  

Was that post for real  I thought it was a late April Fool joke  Some of it
seemed a bit over the top even by McElwaine Abian etc standards
