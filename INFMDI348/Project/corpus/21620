  After reading the posts on this newsgroup for the pasts   months  it 
  has become apparent to me that this group is primarily active with 
  Liberals  Catholics  New Agers   and Athiests   Someone might think 
  to change the name to   soc religion any     or    perhaps even
  soc religion new   It might seem to be more appropriate 
  Heck  don t flame me  I m Catholic  gay  and I voted 
  for Bill Clinton   I m on your side                       

Since when did conservative  protestant  old time religion believers get
an exclusive francise to christianity   Christianity is  and always has
been  a diverse and contentious tradition  and this group reflects that
diversity   I  fo one  am not ready to concede to  any  group  be they
 liberal  or  conservative   catholic  protestant  or orthodox  charismatic
or not  the right to claim that they have  the truth   and everyone else
is not  christian
