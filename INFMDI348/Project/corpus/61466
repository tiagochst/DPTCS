     Also  as implied by other posters  why 
 do you need to boost the orbit on this mission anyway     

You don t  need  to  but it s desirable   HST  like all satellites in
low Earth orbit  is gradually losing altitude due to air drag   It was
deployed in the highest orbit the shuttle could reach  for that reason 
It needs occasional reboosting or it will eventually reenter    It has
no propulsion system of its own    This is an excellent opportunity 
given that there may not be another visit for several years
