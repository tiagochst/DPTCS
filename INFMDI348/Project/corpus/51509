   Quarda     is a popular misspelling of Quadra      which has a    MHz    
   processor  The     has a    MHz      and some local buses on the
   motherboard run faster 

  The video is different also   The     can run a     and I believe a    
  monitor in    bit color without a VRAM upgrade 

     Actually  you could put as much VRAM into a Q    as you want and you
 still won t be able to get    bit color  on any monitor  It s not part
 of the on board video  The Q     however  can use    bit video on
 monitors up to     with  MB of VRAM

Yes  but if you upgrade the VRAM in a     you get    bit color   So
you really don t care   My point is that out the box the     has
more video capability for the same size monitors   The     can
do    bit with both     and      doesn t support      and
does   bit on     monitors
