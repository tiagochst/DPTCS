   the Single Launch Core Station concept   A Shuttle external tank and solid
   rocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit   Shuttle
   main engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch
   and jettisoned after ET separation 
  
  Why jettison the SSMEs   Why not hold on to them and have a shuttle 
  bring them down to use as spares 

Good question    I asked that myself    However  since this option is as
expensive as the Freedom derivative  the issue will likely be moot
