    A bright light phenomenon was observed in the Eastern Finland
    on April     At       UT two people saw a bright  luminous
    pillar shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near
    Mikkeli  The head of the pillar was circular  The lower part
    was a little winding  It was like a monster they told  They
    were little frightened  Soon the yellowish pillar became
    enlarged  A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle
    of the phenomenon  At last the light landed behind the nearby
    forest  Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were
    visible till morning sunrise 

    The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in
    Lappeenranta  At       UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in
    the low northeastern horizont  The altitude of the trail was
    only about     degrees  Soon the trail began to grow taller 
    A loop was appeared in the head of the trail  It was like a
    spoon  This lasted only    seconds  Now the altitude was about
    five degress above horizont  He noted a bright spot at the
    upper stage of loop  The spot was at magnitude     The loop
    became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of
    the loop  A cartwheel shaped trail was appeared round the bright
    spot  After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails
    were only visible in the low horizont  Luminous trails were still
    visible at       UT in the morning sky 

    The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket  I don t know if
    there were satellite launches in Plesetsk Cosmodrome near
    Arkhangelsk  but this may be a rocket experiment too  Since     
    we have observed over    rocket phenomena in Finland  Most of
    these are rocket experiments  military missile tests    barium
    experiments and other chemical releases  During these years we
    have observed    satellite launches
