In article  C y t   w  news cso uiuc edu  gfk      uxa cso uiuc edu  George F  Krumins  writes 
 It is so typical that the rights of the minority are extinguished by the
 wants of the majority  no matter how ridiculous those wants might be 


George 

	It s called a democracy   The majority rules   sorry 
If ytou don t like it  I suggest you modify the constitution to include
a constitutional right to Dark Skies    The theory of government
here is that the majority rules   except in the nature of fundamental
civil rights    If you really are annoyed    get some legislation
to create a dark sky zone   where in all light emissions are protected
in the zone   Kind of like the national radio quiet zone   Did you
know about that   near teh Radio telescope  observatory in West virginia 
they have a          mile EMCON zone   Theoretically they can prevent
you from running light AC motors  like air conditioners and Vacuums 
In practice  they use it mostly to  control  large radio users
