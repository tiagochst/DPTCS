 A while ago I posted a note asking for specs on the Quadra      and opinions on
 the Q    upgrade of a IIci vs  an accelerator card   So far no responsed that
 I ve noticed   Please let me know what you think of these possible upgrade
 paths   Cost  efficiency  pros cons  etc   Thanks 

  Complete Q    are best obtained from your dealer or some recent
copy of MacWorld or MacUser   My foggy memory suggests that the most relevant
comparison factors vis a vis a IIci are as follows 

     MHz      
     Mhz data path  don t recall this for sure  but it s slower
      than Q     style machines for sure  
  Ethertalk card on board
  Audio in out
    MB RAM on motherboard
    SIMM slots
    NuBus slots 
  More flexible build in video than the CI   Uses VRAM 

In comparison  a IIci with an accelerator won t give you
  audio or ethernet  or the same video options 
  With a       accelerator  CPU performance can be comparable but I
  think it ends up costing more
