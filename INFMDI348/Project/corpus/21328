Note  I am cross posting  actually  emailing  this to 
bit listserv catholic while main posting goes to 
soc religion christian 

 Quotations omitted   This is in response to a question about
the Immaculate Conception   I explained it  but left justification
up to our Catholic readers     clh 

There is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the
mention of Mary s  blessedness  full of grace in the  Annunciation  by
Angel Gabriel in Luke        

 And in the  th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto
 a city of Galilee  named Nazareth   To a virgin espoused to a
 man whose name was Joseph  of the house of David  and the virgin s
 name was Mary   And the angel came unto her and said    Hail 
 thou that art highly favoured  the Lord is with thee  blessed
 art thou among women   

Now  now  hold that line of thought    the Lord is with Mary  
blessed art thou among women    while you read on    

In the book   First Lady of the World  A Popular History of
Devotion to Mary  by Peter Lappin 

The  Immaculate Conception  matter is really far more complicated
than the  Assumption    This arose in     AD   It is quite possible
that the feast of  Mary s Conception  under the title  The Conception
of Saint Anne   originally commemorated the  physical miracle  of
a woman  beyond the age  of child bearing  conceiving a daughter 
just as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist   A transfer in
emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle
of grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was  logical    Mary
is the incorruptible timber  out of which was hewn the  tabernacle 
of Christ s sinless body   she is  God s Eden  in whom there is
no tree of knowledge  and no serpent that harms    Her perfect
beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ  her
purity in that of the Father   At the time of the Council of Ephesus 
she was hailed as  innocent  without blemish  immaculate  inviolate 
spotless  holy in soul and body  who was blessed as a lily from
among thorns  unlearned in the evil ways of Eve  
   
At the end of the thirteenth century  an Irish Franciscan 
John Duns Scotus                God maintained that it was a 
greater thing for Him to preserve His  the Son  mother from all
sin  than to use His power to clease her from it later  
   

Now let s go to the discussion of baptism and original sin 
From  Pocket Catholic Cathechism  by John A  Hardon 

Baptism  
Concupiscence Remains after Baptism 
Concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized
but since it is left to provide trial  it has no power to
injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of
Christ Jesus  manfully resist  Canon    

Original gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall 
In the light of the foregoing  we see that our first
parents were originally gifted three times over 
 They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the
 power to think and to choose freely 
 The had the  preternatural  gifts of bodily immortality
 and of integrity  or the internal power to control desires 
 They had the  supernatural  gifts of sanctifying grace 
 the virtues of faith  hope  and charity and the corresponding
 title to enter heaven 
By their disobedience  they lost the  supernatural and
preternatural  gifts entirely  and were weakened  without
losing  their natural capacity to reason and to choose
freely 

Baptism restores the  supernatural  life lost by Adam s
sin   It  does not  restore the  preternatural  gifts
but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our
bodies on the last day   

Going back to  Immaculate Conception 
 I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other
books but it may be another contribution to the  puzzle   

Given the miracle of St  Anne bearing a child at a
non childbearing age  AND Christ was not yet born 
AND  there was no baptism yet  on Mary s birth but
STILL  the Angel Gabriel s greetings was 
 Hail Mary  full of grace  the Lord is with you 
Blessed art thou amongst women  

Even Mary was confused about this greeting 

Mary could very well have possessed all of the
 treefold original gifts above  given to our first
parents  Adam and Eve before their sin  
    Hail Mary  Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel 
    Full of grace  natural  preternatural  supernatural 
    The Lord is with you  At those times  God would
                definitely want to be with those He
                has made  blessed  
    Blessed art thou amongst women  that says it all 

At the conception  God made Mary  full of grace
and blessed  as the  tabernacle  for the coming body
of Christ and so 

Immaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still
has maintained her Immaculate Heart

 P S   I do hope that others will continue more
       light and facts on this matter   Thanks
