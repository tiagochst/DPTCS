   Yes  you get internal mixing of the analog CD Audio outputs with
   the Mac generated audio on the Mac motherboard   Also you can sample
   the CD Audio using the sound control panel by clicking on the Options
   button next to the microphone icon 

  How do you click on the Options button   I ve never seen it undimmed 

     The latest word on this is you have to disconnect the Microphone
 cable on the motherboard  Then the button is supposed to un dim

Sorry  I assumed that the the various new machines with the internal
CD ROM bay worked the same as the Quadra       Obviously they don t 
I can use any of three inputs by changing the radio button under
the sound cp on my Quadra      Microphone  External  and CD ROM   I
always leave the microphone plugged in  even though I never use
it
