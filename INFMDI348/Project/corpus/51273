bobbe vice ICO TEK COM  Robert Beauchaine  writes 

 My personal objection is that I find capital punishment to be
 cruel and unusual punishment under all circumstances 

It can be painless  so it isn t cruel   And  it has occurred frequently
since the dawn of time  so it is hardly unusual 

 I don t take issue with the numbers   A single innocent life taken
 is one too many 

But  innocents die due to many causes   Why have you singled out
accidental or false execution as the one to take issue with
