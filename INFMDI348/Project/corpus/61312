Does anyone have a reference  something I can look up  not just your own
recollections    I have a few of those myself  on the temperature of the
 night  sky as seen from space 

Note  I am  not  talking about the temperature of the Microwave Background
Radiation   There are more things in the sky than just the MBR  what I m
after is total blackbody temperature    what a thermal radiator would see 
disregarding  or shielding against  the Sun and nearby large warm objects 
My dim recollection is that the net effective temperature is substantially
higher than that of the MBR  once you figure in things like stars and the
zodiacal light  but I d like numbers
