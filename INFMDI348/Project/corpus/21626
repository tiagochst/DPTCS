Until recently I always understood the term  kingdom theology  to mean the 
theology of the kingdom of God  but now I have discovered that there is a 
new and more specialized meaning  I gather that it is also called  Dominion 
theology   and that it has to do with a belief that Christians must create a 
theocratic form of government on earth before Christ will come again 

I have not come across anyone who believes or advocates this  but I am told 
that it is a very widespread belief in the USA 

Can anyone give me any more information about it 

Here are some of my questions 

   Is it the teaching of any particular denomination  If so  which 
   Where and when does it start 
   Are there any particular publications that propagate it 
   Are there any organizations that propagate it
