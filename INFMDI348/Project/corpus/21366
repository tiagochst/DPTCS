	Two follow up s to Mark s last posting 

	    As far as current investigations  the Church recently declared the
	    crying statue and corresponding messages from Mary at Akita 
	    Japan as approved  I found this out about a month ago  

	    Again in the proof department  start with the appearances of Mary
	    at Fatima   Among other things  there were pictures taken of the
	     miracle of the sun  that appeared in some major American newspaper
	     The New York Times  I believe  as well as most of the major
	    European newspapers   

	    I could talk  or post  for hours on this topic  but    
		 I have a thesis to write
