 mathew  mathew mantis co uk  writes 
   Perhaps we shouldn t imprision people if we could watch them closely
   instead   The cost would probably be similar  especially if we just
   implanted some sort of electronic device 
  Why wait until they commit the crime   Why not implant such devices in
  potential criminals like Communists and atheists 
  
  Sorry  I don t follow your reasoning   You are proposing to punish people
   before  they commit a crime   What justification do you have for this 

Look up  irony   Keith
