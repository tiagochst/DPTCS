Re  Space billboards

Even easier to implement than writing messages on the Moon  once upon
a time a group of space activists I belonged to in Seattle considered
a  Goodyear Blimp in orbit    The idea was to use a large structure
that could carry an array of lights like the Goodyear Blimp has 
Placed in a low Earth orbit of high inclination  it could eventually
be seen by almost everyone on Earth   Only our collective disapproval
of cluttering up space with such a thing stopped us from pursuing
it   It had quite feasible economics  which I will not post here
because I don t want to encourage the idea  if you want to do such
a thing  go figure it out for yourself
