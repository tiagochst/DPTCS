  But I believe that there is a fundamental difference here   The other x
  three instruments are focusing instruments  that  more or less  form
  an image  so positional errors are limited by craft attitude and the 
  resolving power of the optics   BATSE is an altogether different
  beast  effectively just   coincidence counters  one on each corner of 
  the craft   Positional information is triangulated from the 
  differential signal arrival times at each of the detectors 

This is not quite right   The differential arrival time techinique
requires interplanetary baselines to get good positions   The
differential arrival at the eight detectors differ by    s of nanoseconds 
This is smaller than BATSE s microsecond timing capabilities 
BATSE  Ulysses  and Mars Obsverver are used for this technique 

Each BATSE detector does not have a full sky field of view 
The sensitivity of each detector decreases with increasing 
angle of incidence   The burst position on the sky is determined by
comparing the count rates in different detectors
