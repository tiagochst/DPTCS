 I just wanted to point out  that Teflon wasn t from the space program 
 It was from the WWII nuclear weapons development program   Pipes in the 
 system for fractioning and enriching uranium had to be lined with it 
 
 Uranium Hexafloride was the chemical they turned the pitchblend into for
 enrichment   It is massively corrosive   Even to Stainless steels  Hence
 the need for a very inert substaance to line the pipes with   Teflon has
 all its molecular sockets bound up already  so it is very unreactive 
 
 My   sense worth

The artifical pacemaker was invented in      by Wilson Greatbatch an
American biomedical engineer  The bill authorizing NASA was signed
in October of      so it is clear that NASA had nothing to do with
the invention of the pacemaker
