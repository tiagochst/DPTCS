 Having read in the past about the fail safe mechanisms on spacecraft  I had
 assumed that the Command Loss Timer had that sort of function   However I
 always find disturbing the oxymoron of a  NO OP  command that does something 
 If the command changes the behavior or status of the spacecraft it is not
 a  NO OP  command 
  
I know its semantics  but the  no op   doesn t  do anything   The
Command Loss Timer is simply looking for a command  any command   A
 no op  is simply a spacecraft command that drops bits into the big
bit bucket in the sky    No op  also get used as timekeepers to provide
millisecond delays between command sequences  used on the thruster preps
on GRO  er  Compton  and to verify command links at the beginning of
TDRS events   All in all  a rather useful command   And  an intelligent
FDC test on Galileo  the Command Loss Timer

 still looking for GRO data  even though I m the wrong David
