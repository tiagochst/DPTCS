Concerning Christians praying for coporate forgiveness of national sins  
Michael Covington claims the following of C S  Lewis 

  C  S  Lewis made the same point in an essay after World War II 
  when some Christian leaders in Britain were urging  national repentance 
  for the horrors  sins     of World War II

I was surprised when I heard this same kind of remark from a fellow grad  
student I know  especially since he had seminary training   I have read the 
same essay and do not find Lewis making any such claim   Rather  Lewis is 
condemning the use of such coporate prayer efforts as platforms to make 
political jabs at opponents  feigned as confessions of guilt  ie   Lord please 
forgive us for allowing  insert political issue idea platform  to exist in our
country  it is wrong and we ask your forgiveness     I would be interested in
knowing what part of the essay you feel condemns national repentance  please
