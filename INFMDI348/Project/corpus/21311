In article  May                       geneva rutgers edu  mmh dcs qmw ac uk  Matthew Huntbach  writes 
 I have seen the claims  but I don t know if there are any
 authenticated cases of people making prolonged speeches in
 real languages they don t know  From my observations   speaking
 in tongues  in practice has nothing at all do with this 

I have a simple test  I take several people who can speak
only one language  e g  chinese  russian  german  english  
Then I let the  gifted one  start  speaking in toungues  
The audience should understand the  gifted one  clearly
in their native language  However  the  gifted one  can
only hear himself speaking in his own language 

Works everytime     
Perhaps I would believe the  gifted ones  more if they were
glorifying God rather than themselves  Then perhaps we d
witness a real miracle
