  I want to know what weightlessness actually FEELS like  For example  is
 there a constant sensation of falling  

Yes  weightlessness does feel like falling   It may feel strange at first 
but the body does adjust   The feeling is not too different from that
of sky diving 

 And what is the motion sickness
 that some astronauts occasionally experience  

It is the body s reaction to a strange environment   It appears to be induced
partly to physical discomfort and part to mental distress   Some people are 
more prone to it than others  like some people are more prone to get sick 
on a roller coaster ride than others   The mental part is usually induced by 
a lack of clear indication of which way is up or down  ie  the Shuttle is 
normally oriented with its cargo bay pointed towards Earth  so the Earth 
 or ground  is  above  the head of the astronauts   About     of the astronauts 
experience some form of motion sickness  and NASA has done numerous tests in 
space to try to see how to keep the number of occurances down
