 I used HP DeskJet with Orange Micros Grappler LS on System      
 
 But now I update system       to System  with Kanji Talk     
 then I can not print by my DeskJet 
 Is the Grappler LS old

 Please tell me how to use DeskJet on System  
 Thank you

I currently use an HP DeskJet with Grappler LS ver      
and it works on System    Course  I only use the SWA Dutch
and SWA Swiss fonts that came with it  due to the  x size
requirement to print to the HP   ie  must have   pnt definition
to print a   pnt font   When I upgraded   I talked to Orange
Micro  and they state that ver     of Grappler LS definitely
works with System    However  the upgrade was US     so I
passed 

Hope this helps
