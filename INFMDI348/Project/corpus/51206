 My syllogism is of the form 
 A is B 
 C is A 
 Therefore C is B 

 This is a logically valid construction 

 Your syllogism  however  is of the form 
 A is B 
 C is B 
 Therefore C is A 

 Therefore yours is a logically invalid construction  
 and your comments don t apply 

 I appeal to Mathew  Mantis  here who wrote the excellent
 post  now part of the FAQ  on logical argument 

 Jim B 

I am not Mathew  Mantis  but any  successful  first year logic student will see that you are logically correct  the other poster is logically incorrect 

  
 I know  is nothing more than  I believe  with pretentions
