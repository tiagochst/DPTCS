We have recently obtained a Centris     and it has developed an unusual
video problem  

Model 	    with   MB     HD     K VRAM  no cards
Monitor 	Apple    

When the computer is set for     colors and certain operations are done 
particularly vertical scrolling through a window  horizontal white lines
appear on the monitor  which generally but not always spare open
windows    These lines accummulate as the operation is continued   If a
window is moved over the involved area of the screen and then moved away
the line disappear from that area of the screen   This problem is not
observed if the monitor is configured for    colors or a    inch Apple
monitor with     colors is used  

I suspect a bad video RAM chip but cannot be certain   The problem has
been apparent since day   but has gotten worse 

We were wondering if anyone has seen anything like this  and if so  how
to fix it   Please also respond to azelenet bigmac mskcc org   Thank you
for your help
