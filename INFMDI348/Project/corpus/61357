      I didn t want to quote all the stuff that s been said recently  I
   just wanted to add a point 
   
    
   then enforces those rights for them   Here in the U S   the constitution
   provides a  Bill of Rights  from which most if not all legal rights are
   considered to derive   I m sure that most other countries have
 
 These seem hardly like the groups to discuss this in  but HUH    
 All legitimate power to enforce these rights derives from the consent 
 of the governed  not from no steenkin  piece of paper 
 
   We don t disagree on this   All I said was that a right is whatever
you or somebody acting for you can enforce   The Bill of Rights didn t
come into effect until it was ratified by the states  and indirectly 
the people   from that point it defined legal rights    Common law 
rights are vague and situational  that s why the people insisted on a
Bill of Rights in the Constitution  spelling out exactly what they
demanded from the government   Legitimate or illegitimate  power is
power   That s why the federal government can force states to grant
their citizens rights they don t wish to  In a slugging match  the feds
win   Period 

   And you re right  this doesn t belong in sci space   I ve said my
peace   No more frome me on rights  at least not here  

 Most gracious regards
