Here s a good one  Does anyone know of a product that allows
me to RACK MOUNT my  CI  or maybe     if I blow some more
money         My application is music  and would like to be
able to haul it around  would probably plan to get an MO drive
or something so I don t have to depend on an internal fixed
hard drive   i e   may be pretty rough on an internal HD    

I m in the San Francisco Bay Area  if that matters 
Also  anyone have any info on     s and Midi  And  would anyone
care to email me with the price they paid for their      Or if
there s a price list FAQ  never mind    Just curious about the
difference between the best retailers and the local university
pricing   

Thanks  Jeff Adams
