Well  I seem to have struck an  interesting discussion off   Given that I
am not an astrophysicist  or nuclear physicist   i ll have to boil it
down a bit 

    ALl the data on bursts to date   shows a smooth random distribution 

    that means they aren t concentrated in  galactic cores  our or someone
elses 

   If the distribution is smooth   we are either seeing some  ENORMOUSLY
large phenomena  scattered at the edge of the universe  said phenomena
being subject to debate almost as vioent as the phenomena
	OR
we are seeing some phenomena  out at like the Oort cloud   but then it needs
some potent little energy source   that isn t detectable  by any other
current methods 

    we know it s not real close   like  slightly extra solar   because
we have no parallax measurements on the bursts 

    the bursts seem to bright to be something like black hole quanta or
super string  impacts or something like that 

So everyone is watching the data and arguing like mad in the meanwhile 

what i am wondering   is this in people s opinion   A NEW Physics problem 

Einstein got well known for solvingthe photoelectric effect    

Copernicus   started looking at  irregularities in planetary motion 

Is this a big enough problem  to create a new area of physics 
just a little speculative thinking folks
