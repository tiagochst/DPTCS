henry zoo toronto edu  Henry Spencer  writes 

  Does anyone have a reference  something I can look up  not just your own
  recollections    I have a few of those myself  on the temperature of the
   night  sky as seen from space 

     You ll find that in Allen  C W    Astrophysical Quantities   Athlone
Press  Dover  NH   rd edition  pp                   To the accuracy it can
be calculated  see specific references in Allen about how it is
calculated   the temperature is   degrees K 

     Lots of people have remarked on this temperature   The first may have
been in Eddington s book   Internal Constitution of Stars   Ch           
reprinted        where he gives the  temperature of space  as   degrees 

     The source of this temperature is the radiation of starlight 

  My dim recollection is that the net effective temperature is
  substantially higher than that of the MBR  once you figure in things like
  stars and the zodiacal light  but I d like numbers 

     To the accuracy of measurement  it s the same temperature   Some of us
think this may not be a coincidence     Tom
