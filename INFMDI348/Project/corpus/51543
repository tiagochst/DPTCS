A professor of mine once said  The difference between a Computer Engineer and
a Computer Scientist is about        meaning the Engineer makes       more than
the CS 
Seriously though the main difference is that most CS people write programs that
people will use  i e  database  graphics  word processors  etc   while an
engineer writes for machines or control systems  i e  the  computer  in your
car  a flight control system  computer controled devices  etc  In other words
CS writes SOFTWARE while CSE writes FIRMWARE  
These are generalizations but for the most part that is what the difference is 

P S  The       is not just a joke
