            But try to land a shuttle with that big huge telescope in the 
     back and you could have problems   The shuttle just isn t designed to land 
     with that much weight in the payload 
   
    Is HST really  that  much heavier than a Spacelab    
   
   I can t speak to sheer mass  but part of the problem is that HST
   wasn t built to ever be brought back down   It s not built for those
   kinds of  jolt  forces and there is no support cradle for it  which is
   additional weight that would be required 

Just to throw it out there   The mass of the telescope is        kg 
        lb    I do not know what Space lab weighs  but I believe it is
less   Can anyone verify  

Also  remember that weight was not the only concern  as many others have 
noted  just one possible concern   I was responding to a statement that
if you can boost it  why can t you land it   Those are too different
problems
