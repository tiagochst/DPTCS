  Just a few contributions from the space program to  regular  society 
  
    	Teflon  So your eggs don t stick in the pan 
 
 Sorry to split hairs  but I just read in  The making of the atomic
 bomb     that teflon was developed during world war     A sealant was
 needed for the tubing in which uranium hexafluoride passed as it was
 gradually enriched by difussion   UF  is very corrosive  and some very
 inert yet flexible material was needed for the seals 

I think you re both right   Teflon was actually discovered by accident
before WWII   From what I ve heard  they had some chemical  I assume it
was tetrafluoroethylene  in a tank and but the valve got gummed up 
Cutting it open revealed that it had polymerized 

The material was useful for seals  but it had a major problem for  say
the linings of vessels  it wouldn t stick to metal   What the space
program did was to find a way to get it to stick   Thus we had no stick
frypans on the market in the late    s
