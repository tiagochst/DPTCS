 The point has been raised and has been answered   Roger and I have
 clearly stated our support of the BSA position on the issue 
 specifically  that homosexual behavior constitutes a violation of
 the Scout Oath  specifically  the promise to live  morally straight   

	Please define  morally straight   

	
	
	And  don t even try saying that  straight   as it is used here  
implies only hetersexual behavior    eg   straight  as in the slang word 
opposite to  gay   


	This is alot like  family values   Everyone is talking about them  
but misteriously  no one knows what they are 
   

         One thing that relates is among Navy men that get tatoos that 
        say  Mom   because of the love of their mom   It makes for more 
        virile men
