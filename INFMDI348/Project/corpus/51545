  THere is a defect in the     hi res monitors  bring it to a dealer and 
  they will replace the flyback for free  I think 
  
  
  	I just heard of this problem at work today and we are fixing 
  them for free

The service notice on the     hi res monitors expired         after this  
date Apple will NOT reimburse service providers for the fix  replacement  
of the hi voltage capacitor   All you folks that have been putting up with  
intermittant shutdowns without getting it to your service provider missed  
out on the freebie  It was in force for a year  If you got it free after  
      you got a deal
