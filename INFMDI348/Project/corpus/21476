   Any one who thinks that Homosexuality and Christianity are compatible should check  
   out 
   	Romans     
   	I Corinthians    
   	I Timothy     
   	Jude    
   	II Peter      
   	Gen    
   	Lev       
    to name a few of the verses that pertain to homosexuality 

Anyone who thinks being gay and Christianity are not compatible should 
check out Dignity  Integrity  More Light Presbyterian churches  Affirmation 
MCC churches  etc   Meet some gay Christians  find out who they are  pray
with them  discuss scripture with them  and only  then  form your opinion
