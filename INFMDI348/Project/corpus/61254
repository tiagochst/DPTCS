Having read in the past about the fail safe mechanisms on spacecraft  I had
assumed that the Command Loss Timer had that sort of function   However I
always find disturbing the oxymoron of a  NO OP  command that does something 
If the command changes the behavior or status of the spacecraft it is not
a  NO OP  command 

Of course this terminology comes from a Jet Propulsion Laboratory which has
nothing to do with jet propulsion
