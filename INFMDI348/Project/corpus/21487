 None of the states currently recognize same sex marriages  but I know
 several couples whose  marriages  are more stable and loving and 
 long lasting than most of my legally married friends and relatives 
  This drives one friend s family crazy  His brothers have been
 divorced twice  both his parents are divorced  and  he    the  filthy
 gay    has been  married  to his partner for    years  
 
Just because those   marriages  are more stable and loving and long lasting 
doesn t make it right   Same sex partners could have been best friends 
without getting sexually involved with each other
