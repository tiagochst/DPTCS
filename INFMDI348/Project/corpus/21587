  Pascal s Wager  

  I ve heard this frequently   what exactly is Pascal s wager 

Either A  God exists  or B  He doesn t   We have two choices  either
   Believe in God  or    Don t believe in God   If A is true  then  
brings eternal damnation  whereas   brings eternal life   If B is
true  then   has minor inconvenience compared with     Thus  it is
rational to believe in God

other places 

  	Do I sound  broken  to you 

  I don t know   You point out that your mother s treatment upset you

  disillusionment 

Disillusionment strikes me as an excellent reason for stopping
believing in something
