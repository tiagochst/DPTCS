In article  C DtD  HHI zoo toronto edu  henry zoo toronto edu  Henry Spencer  writes 
 by what the Voyagers did   they exploited a lineup that occurs only
 every couple of centuries  and even so Voyager   took a rather indirect
 route to Neptune 

Indirect compared to what   Did Voyager   traverse a substantially greater
distance than  say  a Hohmann orbit   I ve never heard Voyager s path
described as  indirect  before
