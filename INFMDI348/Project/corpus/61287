jfc  If gamma ray bursters are extragalactic  would absorption from the
jfc  galaxy be expected   How transparent is the galactic core to gamma
jfc  rays 

and later   
      Jim Batka   JBATKA DESIRE WRIGHT EDU   said

JB  So  if the   r   law is incorrect  assume
JB  some unknown material  dark matter    inhibits Gamma Ray propagation  
JB  could it be possible that we are actually seeing much less energetic
JB  events happening much closer to us   The even distribution could
JB  be caused by the characteristic propagation distance of gamma rays 
JB  being shorter then     the thickness of the disk of the galaxy 


   

 Well  maybe not zero  but very little   At the typical energies for 
 gamma rays  the Galaxy is effectively transparent  

 Hans Bloemen had a review article in Ann  Rev  Astr  Astrophys  a few 
 years back in which he discusses this in more depth
