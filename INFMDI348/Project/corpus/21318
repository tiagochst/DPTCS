  This subject was beaten to death on bit listserv christia recently 
  until Madge stepped in and closed the topic   It has been discussed
  since privately in e mail amongst their participants  and I ve 
  received some of it   A fairly large file  approx     KB  of comments 
  made on the March On Washington was among these   If it hasn t been 
  posted here already  I don t know   I just scan through this 
  newsgroup  as at      bps  I couldn t possibly read it all   I would
  be glad to send it along   I believe that it would be of interest to
  people here 
  
  
  I hope that anyone who remembers seeing Rev  Troy Perry s
   performance  at the      March On Washington will see for themselves
  just how inconceivable it is to mix Christianity with homosexuality

You might visit some congregations of Christians  who happen to be homosexuals 
that are spirit filled believers  not MCC rs  before you go lumping us all
together with Troy Perry   

The Lord IS working in our community  the homosexual community  that is    He s
not asking us to change our sexual nature  but He is calling us to practice
the morality that He established from the beginning 

Isn t Satan having a hayday pitting Christian against Christian over any issue
he can  especially homosexuality   Let s reach the homosexuals for Christ  
Let s not try to change them  just need to bring them to Christ   If He
doesn t want them to be gay  He can change that   If they are living a moral
life  committed to someone of the same sex  and God is moving in their lives 
who are we to tell them they have to change 

That s my two cent 

God Bless You All
