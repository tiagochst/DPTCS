In article  C   u  IKC zoo toronto edu   henry zoo toronto edu  Henry Spencer  writes 
      C mon  Allen is telling us how cheap we can get improved this
  or that    
 
 Sure  you can get a heavylift launcher fairly cheap if you do it privately
 rather than as a gummint project   But we re still talking about something
 that will cost nine digits per launch  unless you can guarantee a large
 market to justify volume production 

 Let s make a deal    If you re going to put up a billion  I d want to budget
the whole sheebang for          million   If I have that much money to throw
around in the first place  you betcha I m going to sign a contract committing
to volume production   



    Software engineering  That s like military intelligence  isn t it
