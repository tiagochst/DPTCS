  Why is it more reasonable than the trend towards obesity and the trend towards
  depression  You can t just pick your two favorite trends  notice a correlation 
  in them  and make a sweeping statement of generality  I mean  you CAN  and 
  people HAVE  but that does not mean that it is a valid or reasonable thesis  
  At best it s a gross oversimplification of the push pull factors people 
  experience   

     
 Basically the social interactions of all the changing factors in our society
 are far too complicated for us to control  We just have to hold on to the
 panic handles and hope that we are heading for a soft landing  But one
 things for sure  depression and the destruction of the nuclear family is not
 due solely to sex out of marriage 

Note that I  never  said that depression and the destruction of the
nuclear family is due  solely  to extra marital sex   I specifically
said that it was  a prime cause  of this  not  the prime cause  or  the
only cause  of this    I recognize that there are probably other factors
too  but I think that extra marital sex and subsequent destabilization
of the family is probably a significant factor to the rise in
psychological problems  including depression  in the West in the   th
century
