 Also  ask any electric guitar enthusiast which type of amp they prefer  and
 they ll tell you tube type  since tubes have lower distortion and noise
 than transistors    Course  most of your electric guitar types just say
  Tubes sound better  dude      
 

Of course   they then  turn up the REverb  the Gain   add in the analog
delay line  and the Fuzz box   I d think they wouldn t notice the
distortion    Oh I forgot the phase shifters 

 Also  transistors have the advantage in both waste heat and energy use 
 mainly because of the heaters on the cathodes of the tubes 


Ah   but how do they compare to Mechanical systems
