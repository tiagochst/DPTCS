 There are a number of Philosophical questions that I would like to ask 
 
     If we encounter a life form during our space exploration  how do we
 determine if we should capture it  imprison it  and then discect it 
 
   Analog SF magazine did an article on a similar subject quite a few
years ago   The question was  if an alien spacecraft landed in
Washington  D C   what was the proper organization to deal with it  The
State Department  alien ambassadors   the Defense Department  alien
invaders   the Immigration and Naturalization Service  illegal aliens  
the Department of the Interior  new non human species   etc   It was
very much a question of our perception of the aliens  not of anything
intrinsic in their nature   The bibliography for the article cited a
philosophical paper  the name and author of which I sadly forget  I
believe the author was Italian  on what constitutes a legal and or moral
person  i e   a being entitled to the rights normally accorded to a
person   The paper was quite interesting  as I recall 

     If we encounter a civilization that is suffering economicly  will
 we expend resources from earth to help them 
 
   I think you d have to be very careful here if the answer is yes   The
human track record on helping those poor underpriveleged cultures  does
underpriveleged mean not having enough priveleges   is terrible   The
usual result is the destruction or radical reorganization of the
culture   This may not always be wrong  but that s the way to bet 

     With all of the deseases we currently have that are deadly and undetectable 
 what will be done to ensure that more new deadly deseases aren t brought
 back  or that our deseases don t destroy life elsewhere 
 
    
 Have a day
