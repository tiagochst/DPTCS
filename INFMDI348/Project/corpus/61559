In article  C DF w Bur zoo toronto edu  henry zoo toronto edu  Henry Spencer  writes 
 No   A  dragless  satellite does not magically have no drag  it burns fuel
 constantly to fight drag  maintaining the exact orbit it would have  if 
 there was no drag   This is why there are quotes around  dragless  


I didn t exactly follow the  dragless  satellitte  thread 

What is the point of it   are they used for  laser geodesy  missions 
triad seemed to be some sort of navy navigation bird   but why
be  dragless   why not just update  orbital parameters
