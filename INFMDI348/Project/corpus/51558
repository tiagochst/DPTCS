   I m going to buy a DayStar       with    MHz for the SE     Since there
   were so many mails about problems with this board  my questions 
   does the board work with     and A UX       Does anybody know problems
   with any kind of software  
  
  Well  I haven t seen any reports of problems with the Turbo      
  but to my knowledge  Daystar has not released a version of the 
  board that works with anything but the IIsi and IIci  and they
  have not finished tweaking testing for use with A UX   This may
  not happen until the A UX       upgrade is released  my guess  so 
  I d recommend waiting or buying the    MHz      board and upgrade
  later when A UX compatibility is assured   Turbo      interface 
  cards for the II  IIx  SE     IIcx  etc will probably be available
  sooner  but if A UX compatibility is a requirement  it is probably
  best to be patient and let someone else be the pioneer      

An added advantate of waiting for the DayStar for the SE    is that 
just as with the      power cache  the      accelerator will plug into
the CPU socket  leaving the PDS slot free for a video card or ethernet
card   With DayStar s upgrade path  it s a no lose situation
