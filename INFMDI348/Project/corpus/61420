         Actually  my advisor  another classmate of mine  and me were
 talking the other day about putting just one detector on one of the
 Pluto satellites   THen we realized that the satellite alone is only
 carrying something like     pounds of eq   Well  a BATSE detector
 needs lead shielding to protect it  and   alone weighs about    
 pounds itself 

         We decided against it

Are you talking about a single BATSE component  or
the whole thing 

You  could  propose a BATSE probe  launch two or three with ion
drive on various planetary trajectories    your resolution increaces
the more they re spaced apart  You could probably cheaply eject them
from the solar system with enough flybys and patience 

Things would start out slow  then slowly get better and better
resolution
