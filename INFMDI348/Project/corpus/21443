 And it should be noted that the Monophysite Chruches of Egypt and Syria
 also hold to this belief as part of divine revelation  even though they
 broke away from the unity of the Chruch in     AD by rejecting the
 Council of Chalcedon   It might be argued by some Protestants that the
 Catholics and Orthodox made this belief up  but the Monophysites  put a
 big hole in that notion  as they also hold the belief  and they split
 from the Chruch before the belief was first annunciated in writing  as
 far as is known  much has been lost from the time of the Fathers  

The belief that the churches of Egypt and Syria were  or are  monophysite is 
false  as is the belief that they often held that the Council of Chalcedon 
was Nestorian 

These misunderstandings were exacerbated by political factors  and thus led 
to schism   a schism that is on its way to being healed
