 It has been known for quite a while that the earth is actually more pear
 shaped than globular spherical   Does anyone make a  globe  that is accurate
 as to actual shape  landmass configuration Long Lat lines etc  
 Thanks in advance 

Even if they did  a globe at a scale that you could fit into your average room
or even average  hall  the deviations you mention would not be visually
evident  In other words a micrometer would be required to test the fact that 
the Globe was infact pear shaped
