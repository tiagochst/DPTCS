Forgive me if this has been asked before    but here goes 

My friend recently purchased a LC III and he wants to know if there is
such a demon called NuBus adapter for his PDS slot  CompUsa and
ComputerCity Supercenter says they don t carry them 

Does this mean LC III is incapable of carrying a NuBus board 

Much obiliged
