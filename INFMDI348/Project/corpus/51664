I thnik i ll be able to pick up  a piar of Mac    K s for nothing  but
their power supplies are dead   Anyone know where I can pick up a pair
of refurbished PS s for cheap  preferably mail order  
Yes  I do have uses planned fior them   One will be sold to a friend who
just needs a terminal to connect via modem to his e mail account 
The other will be used by me as a net client to run my downloads and or
printing 
  
Also  what is the latest system software usable with these suckers
