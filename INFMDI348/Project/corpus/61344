	   Also if they did come from the Oort cloud we would expect to
   see the same from other stars Oort Clouds 

That s a very good point   Perhaps none of the nearby stars have Oort
clouds   Alpha centauri is a multiple star system  you wouldn t expect
an Oort cloud in it   What s the nearest single star that is likely to
have a planetary system
