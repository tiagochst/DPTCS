 I hear that the Performa     is really an LCIII with an internal modem   Can
 the modem part be obtained and installed in an LCIII   It would be nice if it
 were actually a powerbook internal modem  but that might be too much to hope
 for 

I believe you were misinformed   I checked out one of the P    s at Sears
last week   The modem is external     bps data with send only FAX
