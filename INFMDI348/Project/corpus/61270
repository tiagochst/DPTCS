  Seen that movie already  Or one just like it 
  Come to think of it  they might send someone on
  a quest to get rid of the dang thing   

 Actually  the idea  like most good ideas  comes from Jules Verne  not

  like most good ideas      please  people  

  The Gods Must Be Crazy    In one of his lesser known books  I can t
 remember which one right now   the protagonists are in a balloon gondola 
 travelling over Africa on their way around the world in the balloon  

 Five Weeks in a Balloon   Not a good idea unless you have helium 
Verne s protagonists didn t  They just got increadibly lucky 

And yes  I knew the title of the movie too  just didn t want to start
talking about it  Except to bring up the image of a team of S  African
Bushmen showing up at a launch site with spears and flint knives
to stop the launch  anyone want to bet on their success in doing so 
especially since they could probably stop a shuttle launch by sneezing
too hard within a couple miles of the launch site
