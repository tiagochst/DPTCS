Subject  Re  A StyleWriter II question
Lines    

 I just read an article on the SWII  One thing puzzles me  the article says the
 SWII is a serial only device  Does that mean I ll have to unplug my modem
each
 time I want to print something   

No  The printer port on the Mac is also serial  It has the same interface as
the ImageWriter II
