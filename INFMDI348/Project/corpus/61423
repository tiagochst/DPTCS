 wAC  The Apollo program cost something like     billion at a time when
 wAC  the value of a dollar was worth more than it is now  No one would
 wAC  take the offer 

If we assume    inflation since       that    B would be worth about     B
GD reckon a moon mission today could cost only    B  Thats a factor of ten
reduction in cost  It might be possible to reduce that number futher by
using a few shortcuts   Russian rockets      Asuming it gets built  I think
the Delta Clipper could very well achive the goal
