In article      Apr                waikato ac nz   I said 

  I know that plugging and unplugging ADB devices with the power on is  not
  supported   and you can hit problems if you have multiple devices with
  clashing addresses  and all that 

I ve had a couple of e mail responses from people who seem to believe that
this sort of thing is not only unsupported  it is downright dangerous 

I have heard of no such warnings from anybody at Apple  Just to be sure  I
asked a couple of our technicians  one of whom has been servicing Macs for
years  There is  no  danger of damaging logic boards by plugging and unplugging
ADB devices with the power on 

SCSI  yes  ADB  no
