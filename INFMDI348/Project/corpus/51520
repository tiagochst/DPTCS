Hi There 
	I am trying to find out a reliable Power Center  it is basically
a surge protector that sits below the monitor and has individual control
for each outlet  Some people have an opinion that none of them work well 
The ones that I could locate in Microcenter catalogue were 

Tripp Lite s Isobar Command COnsole      

Proxima Power Director        

Kensington Masterpiece Plus         

Has anyone used one of these  Could you please send me your feedback
on these 

thanks

 shalabh
