 I have heard of no such warnings from anybody at Apple  Just to be sure  I
 asked a couple of our technicians  one of whom has been servicing Macs for
 years  There is  no  danger of damaging logic boards by plugging and unplugging
 ADB devices with the power on 

The problem is that the pins in the ADB connector 
are close to each other  and if you happen to bend the
cable a little while inserting it  you short the ADB
port  If you take it to an Apple Repair Centre  that
means a new motherboard  though a component replace IS
physically possible 

Same goes for serial ports  LocalTalk as well 

Cheers
