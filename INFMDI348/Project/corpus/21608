 I don t necessarily object to the secrecy but I do question it  since I see no 
 Biblical reason why any aspect of Christian worship should involve secrecy   

Early in Church history  the catechumens were dismissed prior to the celebration 
of the Eucharist   It WAS secret  giving rise to the rumors that Christians
were cannibals and all sorts of perverse claims   The actions were considered
too holy to be observed by non Christians  as well as potentially dangerous
for the individual Christian who might be identified
