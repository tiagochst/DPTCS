My  my  my   I knew that I would receive a response to my post  but not
THIS extensive   Thank you to all who responded  it at least showed that
people were willing to think about it  even though the general response was
a return to the same old  Why should it matter   question   To those of you
who were a part of this response  I suggest that you read the articles
covering this same question in soc culture african american  for you are in
DIRE need of some cultural enlightenment 

Hasta luego

Sherlette
