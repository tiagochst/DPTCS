I m wondering if  vandalize  is the proper word to use in this situation   My
dictionary defines  vandalism  as  the willful or malicious destructuion of 
public or private property  especially of anything beautiful or artisitc   I
would agree the sky is beautiful  but not that it is public or private property 

I personally prefer natural skies  far from city lights and sans aircraft   
However  there is also something to be said for being able to look up into the
sky and see a satellite   Many people get a real kick out of it  especially if
they haven t seen one before
