  I love the idea of an inflatable   mile long sign     It will be a
  really neat thing to see it explode when a bolt   or even better  a
  Westford Needle   comes crashing into it at    clicks a sec   

   BOOM    Whooooooooshhhhhh         sputter  sputter 

   okay  PRETEND it would make a sound  
                                      

Just a thought     let s pretend it IS INFLATED and PRESSURIZED  wouldn t
there be a large static electricity build up around the puncture 
If the metalization is behind a clear sandwich  ie  insulated  then the 
deflating balloon would generate electrical interference    noise 

By the way  any serious high velocity impact would simply cut a  Bugs
Bunny  hole through the wall  highly unlikely to  BOOM   and the fabric
would almost certainly be ripstop
