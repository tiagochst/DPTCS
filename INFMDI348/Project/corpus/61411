 If re boosting the HST by carrying it with a shuttle would not damage it 
 then why couldn t HST be brought back to earth and the repair job done
 here 
  
 Is it because two shuttle flights would be required  adding to the alredy
 horrendous expense 
  

I don t think a reboost exercise is analogous to a shuttle landing launch
in terms of stresses misalignments etc   I would think of the reboost as
a gentile push  where a landing  then launch as two JOLTS which would
put more mechanical stress on the instruments   Additionally  there might
be a concern about landing loads to the shuttle in the event of a laden
landing   Finally  probably some thought went into possible contamination 
problems if the instruments came back to earth 

Of course  the cost of two shuttle launches  is  a good reason to avoid
something that might be done in one shuttle launch   Here s hoping
Cepi s gang gets the job done right the first time
