 As St  Augustine said   I did not invent original sin  which the
 Catholic faith holds from ancient time  but you  who deny it  without a
 doubt are a follower of a new heresy     De nuptiis  lib     c     
 
 Why is it fair to punish you  me and the rest of humanity because of
 what Adam and Eve did  Suppose your parents committed some crime before
 you were born and one day the cops come to your door and throw you in
 jail for it  Would you really think that is fair  I know I wouldn t 

   You may not think that it is fair  but how many sins do you know of
that affect only the sinner   Is it fair for us even to be able to get
into Heaven   Do we have a  right  to Heaven  even if we were to lead
sinless lives   Anyway  your argument seems to be saying   If  I  were
God  I certainly wouldn t do things that way  therefore  God doesn t do
things that way  

	Isaiah        

	 For my thoughts are not your thoughts  neither are your ways my
	ways  saith the LORD   For as the heavens are higher than the
	earth  so are my ways higher than your ways  and my thoughts
	than your thoughts  

   Original Sin is biblical 

	Romans         

	 Wherefore  as by one man sin entered into the world  and death
	by sin  and so death passed upon all men  for that all have
	sinned   For until the law sin was in the world  but sin is not
	imputed when there is no law   Nevertheless death reigned from
	Adam to Moses  even over them that had not sinned after the
	similitude of Adam s transgression  who is the figure of him
	that was to come  

	  Corinthians       

	 For as in Adam all die  even so in Christ shall all be made
	alive
