I had the same question for my   lb NEC  FG monitor  The Apple guy said that
their   lb     monitor is OK to put ontop of the Centris and had no coment
beyond that  I was going to just put the NEC on the box but then I got to 
thinking   the monitor has a small tilt swivel base so maybe the weight
would be more concentrated than with Apple s  I don t know the area of the 
base of their tilt swivel   Additionally  the CDROM drive is in the middle 
So I cut a piece of      thick wood to about        x      covered it in a 
cream covered cloth  and used it as a buffer layer between the Centris s top
and the monitor
