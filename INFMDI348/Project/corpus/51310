Keith M  Ryan  kmr  po CWRU edu  wrote 
  
  	Wild and fanciful claims require greater evidence  If you state that 
  one of the books in your room is blue  I certainly do not need as much 
  evidence to believe than if you were to claim that there is a two headed 
  leapard in your bed    and I don t mean a male lover in a leotard   

Keith  

If the issue is   What is Truth  then the consequences of whatever
proposition argued is irrelevent  If the issue is   What are the consequences
if such and such  is  True   then Truth is irrelevent  Which is it to
be
