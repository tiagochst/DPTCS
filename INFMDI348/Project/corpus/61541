   How much energy does a burster put out   I know energy depends on
   distance  which is unknown   An answer of the form  X  ergs per
   megaparsec   is OK 
   
 different spheres  R    pc Oort Cloud Radius   R     pc at the edge of the
 galaxy   R      pc or the edge of the galactic corona  and lastly at a
 R     Mpc   
         For a radius of     pc  we found an L around       erg sec   Pretty
 energetic for close by   for the coronal model  we found around       erg sec 
 And lastly  for the cosmological model an L        That s what you d call
 moderately energetic  I d say   Any suggestions about what could put out that
 much energy in one second

Supernovae put out       or        i forget which  but it s only an
order of magnitude       Not in gamma rays  though   You d hafta get
all of that into gammas if they were at   Mpc  but if a decent fraction
of the SN output was in gammas it could reasonably be extragalactic 
 but closer than   Mpc    I dunno SN theory so well  but I can t think
of how to get many gammas out   Maybe I should look it up 

Big radio galaxies can put out       erg s  continually    That s just
in the radio    there are a lot of gammas around them  too  but  bursts  
Nah 

Neither of these should be taken as explanations    just trying to show
that those energies  are  produced by things we know about
