  I believe one could take a view like this even while accepting the
  views Paul expressed in Rom     One may believe that homosexuality is
  not what God intended  that it occured as a result of sin  but still
  conclude that at times we have to live with it   Note that in the
  creation story work enters human life as a result of sin   This
  doesn t mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved 

Please note that God commanded Adam to work before the fall 

 The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work
 it and take care of it    Gen       NIV    

Work was God s design from the beginning

 I ll clarify the wording   There was obviously a rather different
kind of labor imposed after the fall  but the statement as it
stands is misleading     clh
