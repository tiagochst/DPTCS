 Ok  what s more important to gay Christians   Sex  or Christianity 
 Christianity I would hope   Would they be willing to forgo sex
 completely  in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others 
 to avoid the chance that their interpretation might be wrong 
 etc   If not  why not   Heterosexuals abstain all the time 
  It would be nice if protestant churches had celibate orders
 to show the world that sex is not the important thing in life 

The biblical arguments against homosexuality are weak at best  yet
Christ is quite clear about our obligations to the poor  How as 
Christians can we demand celibacy from homosexuals when we walk
by homeless people and ignore the pleas for help  
Christ is quite clear on our obligations to the poor 

Thought for the day 

MAT     And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother s eye  but
considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye  Or how wilt thou say to
thy brother  Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye  and  behold  a beam
is in thine own eye   
   
        The Love of Christ is contagious 
       MAT       Woe unto you  scribes and Pharisees  hypocrites  for ye are 
       like unto whited sepulchres  which indeed appear beautiful outward  
       but are within full of dead men s bones  and of all uncleanness
