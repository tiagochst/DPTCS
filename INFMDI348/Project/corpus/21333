In article  May                       athos rutgers edu 
koberg spot Colorado EDU  Allen Koberg  writes 

        about tongues      

  The concept of tongues as used at Pentecost seems an outdated concept
  now   With the Bible available in nearly every language  and missionaries
  who are out there in ALL languages  why does the church need tongues 

I guess there are at least some people who are not able to support
this claim  There are still a lot of languages without the Bible  or a
part of the Bible  There are still many languages which we are not
able to write  simply because the written version of the language has
not yet been defined 

I guess this is one of the main goals for Wycliffe Bible Translators 
To define rules and a grammar for writing the  rest  of the languages
of this world  I do not see that any of them will have any reason to
become unemployed during the foreseeable future   Provided they get
their neccessary support   And still they are one of the   largest
missionary organizations of the world
