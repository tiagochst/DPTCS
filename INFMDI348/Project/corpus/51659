I am having trouble with SCSI on a Mac IIfx  The machine is   years old
and I have been using the same hard drive  internal Maxtor LXT    S  for
two and a half years  The disk recently crashed  I reformatted  Silverlining
       but during the reformat I received random write errors during testing 
The error message reported was like 

Sector    Write error detected after testing good   sector not mapped out 

This occurred randomly all over the hard disk  which makes me suspect the
diagnostic s reference to Sector          On the third reformat and after
reinstalling the SCSI read write loops I was able to get through passes
     and   with no errors   Pass   for some reason reported a lot of errors 
but still mapped out no sectors   I decided to go ahead and try to resinstall
System   and reload my data from a backup  This proceded normally  however 
I now have sub optimal performance  Symptoms include 

   o Frequent crashes
   o Instances of extremely sluggish disk access requiring a reboot to
       correct 
   o Instances of not finding the disk on the SCSI chain on reboot 
         If I boot from Norton Utl  after this occurs  it cannot find the
         disk either 
         The only thing that fixes this is recycling the power  It sometimes
         requires several attempts 

QUESTIONS 

      Has anyone had this type of problem before 
      Is the problem with the fx motherboard  And its non standard
      SCSI implementation  or with my Maxtor Disk  Is there some
      diagnostic software that would help me make this determination 
      Is it a termination problem  I currently have external Syquest
      and an external DataFrame XP   on the chain  The XP   is at the
      end  and has internal termination  so I am not using the IIfx
      terminator  I do have the SCSI filter installed on the internal
      drive  I have run with this exact steup for       years with
      one previous disk crash requiring a reformat  about a year ago  
      I also have symptoms if I disconnect the external devices 
      so I don t see how SCSI termination would now be an issue  Of
      course who knows    

Help would be much appreciated
