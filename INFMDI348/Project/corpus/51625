  Now if I can figure out if there s any hope using the  partition  button
  on the hard disk setup utility  do I dare just try it and see what happens   
  then maybe I can divide up the wealth among the family members a bit more
  securly   The  getting more information  section of the manual suggested
  trying other avenues before calling Apple  but didn t mention the net

The Partition button in Apple s HD Setup lets you set up A UX and other
types of partitions  It WON T let you create more than one normal mac
volume  You need SilverLining or something similar to do that  It WILL 
however  allow you to take advantage of some possible unused space on your
hard disk  if you don t mind reformatting the whole thing
