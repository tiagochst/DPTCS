     God is eternal      A   B 
     Jesus is God        C   A 
     Therefore  Jesus is eternal    C   B 
  
     This works both logically and mathematically   God is of the set of
     things which are eternal   Jesus is a subset of God    Therefore
     Jesus belongs to the set of things which are eternal 
  
  Everything isn t always so logical    
  
  Mercedes is a car 
  That girl is Mercedes 
  Therefore  that girl is a car 

Unfortunately your phrasing is ambiguous   Re writing more carefully  we have
 at least  two possibilities   The first 

Things called  Mercedes  are cars
That girl is called  Mercedes 
Therefore that girl is a car

That is entirely valid as a piece of logical deduction   It is not sound 
because the first statement is false   Similarly  I would hold that Jim s
example is valid but not sound 

Another possible interpretation of what you wrote is 

There exists at least one car called  Mercedes 
That girl is called  Mercedes 
Therefore that girl is a car

   which isn t valid
