 Roger and I have
 clearly stated our support of the BSA position on the issue 
 specifically  that homosexual behavior constitutes a violation of
 the Scout Oath  specifically  the promise to live  morally straight   
 
 There is really nothing else to discuss 

Apparently not 

In response to his claim that it  terrifies  gay people not to be able
to  indoctrinate children to our lifestyle   or words to that effect  
I sent Roger a very calm  carefully written  detailed letter
explaining simply why the BSA policy does  indeed terrify me   I did
not use inflammatory language and left myself extremely open for an
answer   Thus far  I have not received an answer   I can conclude only
that Roger considers his position either indefensible or simply not
worth defending 

 Trying to cloud the issue
 with comparisons to Blacks or other minorities is also meaningless
 because it s like comparing apples to oranges  i e   people can t
 control their race but they can control their behavior  

In fact  that s exactly the point  people can control their behavior 
Because of that fact  there is no need for a blanket ban on
homosexuals 

 What else is there to possibly discuss on rec scouting on this issue 

You tell me
