   Hi  I own an LCIII and I recently heard an interesting rumor 
   I heard that the LCIII has a built in slot for a PowerPC chip 
   Is this true  I heard that the slot is not the same as the PDS
   slot   Is that true 
   
   Thanks

Well  I also have an LC III   Popping the top revealed 

	One  socket  for an additional VRAM SIMM

	One  socket  for a    pin RAM SIMM

	One socket for a flat pack FPU

	A processor direct slot  PDS  identical to the LC LC II  but with
	an additional set of connetions to one side  for the full    bit
	data path that the LC LC II lacked

That s it   I guess a board with a PowerPC chip could be made that would fit
in the PDS  but that s the only place
