      There s one thing about Windows that really frosts me 
 I have   MB of RAM installed in my system  I use a  MB     MB
 under Windows  disk cache  and a  MB permanent swap file 
 
      While I can never fill the memory up  I still have problems
 sometimes because I run out of GDI resources  What gives 
 I think Windows could manage these resources a little better 
 
Are you using Windows     or      If you re still on          devotes about
twice as much memory to these and runs out much less frequently  If     
you might use one of the resource monitors  such as the one that comes with
the Windows     Resource Kit or one of the many shareware ones available 
to see which programs are hogging the resources  every icon  internal
graphics brush  etc  in every program running uses a certain amount of
this limited memory area  Also  some don t give it back when they re
finished
