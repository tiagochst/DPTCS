 are you sure   g is the right number  as far as i know  pilots are
 blackout in dives that exceed  g    g    g seems to be out of human
 tolerance  would anybody clarify this please 

 lan

Apart from the fact that you get G in the pull out  not the dive  that
figure is about right for sustained G  no protection 
The duration of G  it s rate of onset  body position and support aids are
all critical parts of the equation  I remember one note about instrumented
gridiron players recording peaks about    G  Stapp  the aviation doctor 
either by accident or design  took a short period   G in a rocket sled
decelleration  eye balls out against a standard       s  harness  It had
to be short  calculate the stopping time  even from          mph at that
G  A bang seat can get up to about    G  and you d better be sitting
straight  Find the book by Martin Bakers human guinea pig to hear how bad
it can get if the rate of onset is too high  A reclining position and a
good G suit can keep a pilot functioning at around   G 

A flotation tank should be a good bet  since you can treat the body as a
fluid  and high pressure situations are not new  Anyone have any figures
