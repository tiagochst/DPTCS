  I have never heard of any serious consideration that HST might be brought 
  down for refurbishment   You would have the horrendous cost of transporting 

Back in January and February there were several articles  Wash Post  Time    
saying that NASA was  considering  the option just as it is now  considering 
a followup mission      months after the servicing mission   However  the
down time was estimated to be a year   servicing  checkout  sceheduling
and training another shuttle  orbit verification     and to be quite
expensive   I think it may have been more a mental exercise than a
real plan   Don t know
