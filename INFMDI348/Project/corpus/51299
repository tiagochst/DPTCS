In article      Apr               monu  cc monash edu au   darice yoyo cc monash edu au  Fred Rice  writes 
   There has been some discussion on the pros and cons about sex outside of
   marriage 
     
   
   Where is the evidence for my opinions   At the moment  there are just
   generalities I can cite   For example  I read that in the   th century 
   the percentage of youth  and people in general  who suffer from
   depression has been steadily climbing in Western societies  probably
   what I was reading referred particularly to the USA    Similarly  one
   can detect a trend towards greater occurrence of sex outside of marriage
   in this century in Western societies    particularly with the  sexual
   revolution  of the    s  but even before that I think  otherwise the
    sexual revolution  of the    s would not have been possible  
   particularly with the gradual weakening of Christianity and consequently
   Christian moral teachings against sex outside of marriage   I propose
   that these two trends    greater level of general depression in society
    and other psychological problems  and greater sexual promiscuity    are
   linked  with the latter being a prime cause of the former   I cannot
   provide any evidence beyond this at this stage  but the whole thesis
   seems very reasonable to me and I request that people ponder upon it

I think this is a big leap sex  depression   One example is myself 
where no sex  depression     But  seriously    promiscuity is on a decline 
depression is not and    it might be more reasonable to say 
depression  promiscuity   I think depression is more likely to come
from emotional problems  relationships  family  job  friends  and
promiscuity is used as an escape 
Since I see marriage as a civil and religious bond rather than an
emotional bond  I don t see a problem with sex before  not outside of 
marriage so long as you have the same commitment and devotion as
what is expected from a married couple   Of course  this is just 
my opinion
