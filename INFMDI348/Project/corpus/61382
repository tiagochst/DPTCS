         But try to land a shuttle with that big huge telescope in the 
  back and you could have problems   The shuttle just isn t designed to land 
  with that much weight in the payload 

 Is HST really  that  much heavier than a Spacelab    

I can t speak to sheer mass  but part of the problem is that HST
wasn t built to ever be brought back down   It s not built for those
kinds of  jolt  forces and there is no support cradle for it  which is
additional weight that would be required 

   
 Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don t have the balls to live
