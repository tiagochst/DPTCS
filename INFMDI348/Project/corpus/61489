 I think we  should  tell them about the things that they are using now that
 are spinoffs of the space program   That is the only way you can  prove

 BTW  don t forget Velcro   

at least be honest   velcro  tm  dates from the    s   i have doubts
about everything listed above   just because it was developed in the
