   Yes  you get internal mixing of the analog CD Audio outputs with
   the Mac generated audio on the Mac motherboard   Also you can sample
   the CD Audio using the sound control panel by clicking on the Options
   button next to the microphone icon 
  
   What s this   My IIvx with an internal CD doesn t have any  CD Audio 
   icon   

 I can t find any such option on my Centris     either  On the other hand  I
 don t see why I need one  If I try recording sound with the built in
 microphone with an audio CD playing in the drive  I get the CD audio mixed
 in with the microphone sound 

 And I guess if I unplug the microphone  then I ll get uncontaminated CD
 audio  admittedly sampled at   bits through a D A D conversion  

Sorry about the misinformation   I made a bad assumption about
the new machines behaving like a Quadra      see previous
post   About sampling the CD audio though  have you tried it   I 
found the aliasing to be really bad   Like it needed a filter or something 
Much worse than I expected   I installed the CD     in the 
Quadra myself so maybe I missed something   Everything else
works great though
