I have just been introduced to Macintosh systems 
I have a few questions   E mail prefered 

   Just what is System     I want hard details not dingy commercials
like their ads in magazines   

   Has anyone used the Microsoft Office       I would like
suggestions on  and descriptions on 
  each has a microsoft before the actual name 

a   Word     
b   Excel     
c   Power Point 
d   Mail    

    What is the major differences between Mac Wordperfect and Word 

Thanks a lot
