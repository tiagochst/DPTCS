   Samuel           RSV    
     
 Anyhow  many interpret this to mean that the child has gone to Heaven
  where David will someday go   I don t claim to know for sure if this
 applies to all babies or not  But even if it s just this one  what
 would you say to this 

   That brings up an interesting question   If this interpretation is
correct  how would these people be getting into Heaven before Jesus
opened the gates of Heaven
