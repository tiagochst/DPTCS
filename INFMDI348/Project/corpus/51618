 There s this old SE here  It s got the older style fans that remind
 me of a house ventilator  A cylindrical drum instead of the bladed rotor
 I usually see  Anyway  the SE makes this loud buzzing noise due
 to vibration somewheres  If I remove the screws and loosen the front
 from the back  it quiets down  I can only assume that the fan housing
 from this goofy thing is touching the back of the case and vibrating
 against it  
 
 Anyway  any suggestions for where to get replacement fans and how to
  stealth  this guy  Your experiences welcome     
 
    
  If everything had gone as planned  everything would have been perfect

When I owned an SE  I replaced the fan with SE Silencer  available  I
believe  from MacWarehouse or MacConnection   It comes with instruction for
installation and requires no soldering   Worked like a charm   I think the
manufacturer is Mobius
