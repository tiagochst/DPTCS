After reading the posts on this newsgroup for the pasts   months  it 
has become apparent to me that this group is primarily active with 
Liberals  Catholics  New Agers   and Athiests   Someone might think 
to change the name to   soc religion any     or    perhaps even
soc religion new   It might seem to be more appropriate 
Heck  don t flame me  I m Catholic  gay  and I voted 
for Bill Clinton   I m on your side
