In article  chrisb           bAARNie   chrisb tafe sa edu au  Chris BELL  writes   
 	killing is wrong
 	if you kill we will punish you
 	our punishment will be to kill you 
  
 Seems to be lacking in consistency 

Not any more so than

      holding people against their will is wrong
      if you hold people against their will we will punish you
      our punishment will be to hold you against your will

Is there any punishment which isn t something which  if done by a private
person to another private person for no apparent reason  would lead to
punishment    Fines  I suppose
