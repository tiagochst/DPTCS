 My friend recently purchased a LC III and he wants to know if there is
 such a demon called NuBus adapter for his PDS slot  CompUsa and
 ComputerCity Supercenter says they don t carry them 

 Does this mean LC III is incapable of carrying a NuBus board 

    Yes  That is exactly what it means  The LC family of Macs can only
use PDS cards  They are not able to use NuBus
