 I know it s only wishful thinking  with our current President 
 but this is from last fall 
 
       Is there life on Mars   Maybe not now   But there will be

Lets hear it for Dan Goldin   now if he can only convince the rest of
our federal government that the space program is a worth while
investment 

I hope that I will live to see the day we walk on Mars  but
we need to address the technical hurdles first   If there s sufficient
interest  maybe we should consider starting a sci space group 
devoted to the technical analysis of long duration human spaceflight 
Most of you regulars know that I m interested in starting this analysis
as soon as possible
