On Sunday   May       Kenneth Engel writes  in substance  

  We are told that the penalty for sin is an eternity in Hell 
  We are told that Jesus paid the penalty  suffering in our stead 
  But Jesus did not spend an eternity in Hell 

This objection presupposes the  forensic substitution  theory of the
Atonement  Not everyone who believes in the Atonement understands it
in those terms  For an expansion of this statement  send the
