  Hello 
  
  I recently tried to print some envelopes using AmiPro     with my
  Deskjet     printer  and I seem to be having a problem   What
  happens is after I physically load the envelope into the printer
   per the user manual  and then select the  Print Envelope  icon
  from AmiPro  all of the proper options have been selected   the
  printer just  spits out  the envelope without any printing of
  either a return address or the selected mailing address   At
  this point  the printer s  ONLINE  light begins to flash  and
  the Print Manager shows the printer job as busy   This is all
  that happens  until I either shut the printer off or cancel the
  printing job from the Print Manager   I have also tried this
  without the use of the Print Manager  with similar results 
   AmiPro shows the printer as being busy    So  does anybody
  have any idea solution regarding this problem   I appreciate
  the help   Thanks 

Yes   ignore the manual   Just insert the evelope   don t use the keypad
to move it up   The Windows driver sends a message to the printer that
tells it to load the envelope   if it is already loaded  it gets ejected
and the printer tries to load another   The instructions in the manual
are for dumb DOS apps  that don t send the  load envelople  message
