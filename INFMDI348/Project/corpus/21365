     Nothing unclean shall enter  heaven    Rev          Therefore 
babies are born in such a state that should they die  they are cuf off
from God and put in hell  which is exactly the doctrine of St  Augustine
and St  Thomas   Of coures  having only original sins on thier souls 
they suffer the lightest punishment  the loss of the vision oand
presence of God  but that does not change the undeniable fact that they
cannot possibly come to a forgivenss of original sin  nor can they
inherit eternal life    That   as St  Augustine said   Is what the
Pelagian heretics taught    Which is why he said later   If you want to
be a Christian  do not teach that unbaptized infants can come to a
forgivenss of original sin   

Doesn t the Bible say that God is a fair god   If this is true  how can this
possibly be fair to the infants
