    Can running a PowerBook s battery completely flat have any
    detrimental side effects  other than the PB not going    I ask 
   
   Only two things I can think of 
       Although NiCad                 c          batteries should be  
completely
       discharged about once a month  LeadAcid batteries       shouldn t  
ever be
       completely discharged  well  maybe ONCE in a while is OKAY  
   
  This is a very common mis conception dealing with Ni cad batteries   It  
is 
  a good idea to completely discharge a ni cad CELL periodically   It is
  NOT a good idea to completely discharge a ni cad BATTERY   The  
difference
  being that a cell is only one cell  nicad puts out     volts  like a
  rechargeable AAA  AA  C  or D   A battery is defined as more than one
  cell    volt  or     for nicad equivalent    Due to differences in the
  individual cells of a battery  complete discharge can actually harm
  a nicad battery more than help it overcome the  memory effect    The
  most common problem is that over time an individual cell can develop
  internal shorts  which will weaken other cells that are connected to
  it  thus reducing the lifespan of your battery pack 
  
etc    

Okay  naive question  How does one discharge a cell without discharging  
the entire battery
