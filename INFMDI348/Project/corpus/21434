 much deleted  

     It bugs me when I see this kind of nonsense 

     First  there is no reasonable evidence linking Masonry to ancient
Egypt  or even that it existed prior to the late   th century  and
there s nothing definitive before the   th  

     Second  worship of Osiris is not  nor has it ever been  a part of
Masonic practice  we are strictly non denominational  

 tangents  never ending tangents
