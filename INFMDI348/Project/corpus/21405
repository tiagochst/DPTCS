 Which Version of the Bible do you consider to be the most
 accurate translation 

Well  knowing Greek and Hebrew  I m probably not as picky about translations
as I would be if English translations were my only source of information 
BUT   

    Any verse that comes out substantially different in different trans 
lations is almost certainly unclear in the original  

    It is very bad practice to  shop  for a translation that fits your own
doctrinal positions 

Personally  I still like the RSV   NRSV and NASV are also very good 

I have a strong preference for editions that do  not  indent the beginning
of each verse as if verses were paragraphs   The verse numbering is a
relatively modern addition and should not be given undue prominence
