 There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread
 that are a little confusing  An atheist is one for whom all things can
 be understood as processes of nature   exclusively  There is no need
 for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything  There is
 no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by
 physics  chemistry  biology  etc   everything is random  nothing is
 determnined 

	This posts contains too many fallacies to respond too 

	   The abolishment of divinity requires the elimination of 
freewill  

	You have not shown this  You have not even attempted to  However 
the existance of an Omniscience being does eliminate freewill in mortals  

	  Posted over five months ago  No one has been able to refute it  
nor give any reasonable reasons against it 

  


        Satan and the Angels do not have freewill   
        They do what god tells them to do
