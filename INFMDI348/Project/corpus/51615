 I don t know about the specific problem mentioned in your
 message  but I definitely had SCSI problems between my
 Q    and my venerable Jasmine Megadrive    cartridge
 drives   My solution was to get Silverlining   None of
 the loops that involved blind writes worked to the drives 
 in fact the only loop that worked was the  Macintosh
 Software  loop  whatever that means  

I doubt this is a Quadra specific problem   I had to get
rid of my  venerable  Bernoulli    last year  with enough 
cartridges purchased at      each to make the whole thing 
worth more than my whole computer      The tech support guys
at Ocean Microsystems suggested that some third party drivers 
might fix the problem   in my case the cartridges wouldn t 
format mount partition for A UX
