Well   you better not get the shuttle as your launch vehicle 

and most ELV s have too  far of a backlog for political messages 

If during the campaign season   the candidates for president had
launched one   right around now we d  be getting a launch
for PEROT    

and if they had used the shuttle   we d be seeing launches
for NIXON now more then ever
