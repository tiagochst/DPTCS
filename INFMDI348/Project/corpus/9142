    Yes  and it is the fastest defrag I ve ever watched   It did a    MB 
    hard disk in    minutes 
   
   	I found the MS defrag looks very much like Norton Speedisk 
   Is it just a strip down version of the later 
   
   	I have both Norton Speedisk and Backup  so I was wondering 
   if I need to install MS Backup

If you have Norton Utility  don t bother
