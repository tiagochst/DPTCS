I am in charge of purchasing some computer software for a small office and I
have a few question about Microsoft s Office Pack   

    I was wondering  are the programs that are packaged with the Office
Pack  WinWord  Power Point  Excel  and ccMail  complete and the latest
addition 

   Are the programs  hobbled  in any way  

   Can we update single programs at a latter date   i e  from Excel     to
Excel     

   Do you receive all of the necessary disks and documentation 

   Is there anything that I should be aware of that makes the Office Package
less of deal that it seems 

Sorry if I seem skeptical put the price for the Office Package          on the
street  sounds like a great deal for the office that is purchasing its first
computer and software   But all four complete programs for less than     
makes me just a little suspicious   Maybe its just me   

Thanks for your help in advance
