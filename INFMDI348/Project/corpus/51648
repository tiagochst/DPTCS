I m considering adding a floptical drive to my current system 

What I would like to know is which floptical drives are recommended for
their quality and performance 

My preference would be floptical drives capable of handling both    k and
   k floppies  but handling    k floppies is not a necessity 

So far  I only know a bit about the Iomega floptical and the Infinity
floptical drives   Are there any comments recommendations for either of these 

Are there any other floptical drives that are worth looking into and where
can they be purchased  i e  which mail order places  etc  

Thanks in advance
