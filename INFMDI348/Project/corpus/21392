 Any one who thinks that Homosexuality and Christianity are compatible should check  
 out 
 	Romans     
 	I Corinthians    
 	I Timothy     
 	Jude    
 	II Peter      
 	Gen    
 	Lev       
  to name a few of the verses that pertain to homosexuality 

Homosexual Christians have indeed  checked out  these verses   Some of
them are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations 
Others simply do not address the issues 

You would seem to be more in need of a careful and Spirit led course
in exegesis than most of the gay Christians I know   I suggest that
you stop  proof texting  about things you know nothing about
