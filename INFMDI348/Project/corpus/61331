    radiation field has been measured and modeled by various groups   If I
 remember things correctly  the models involved contributions from three
 different BB sources  so there s no obvious  temperature  of background
 radiation in our local area   

Indeed  the sky doesn t look much like a black body if you look carefully
enough  in particular  its temperature at radio frequencies is quite a
bit higher than you would see from a black body   Morgan Gordon s fat
 Communications Satellite Handbook  has a graph of sky temperature vs 
wavelength  in fact  for communications design 

However  in terms of energy content  the RF frequencies are negligible 
For thermal purposes  at very large distances from the Sun the sky
looks like a black body at    K  Allen   Astrophysical Quantities   
I haven t found a number for non large distances  since solar radiation
tends to be something you can t just ignore      but M G says  about  K 
in a brief discussion of why solar radiation dominates the problem
