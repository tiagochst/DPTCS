 	Often times  most recently on this list in the last few days  I ve
 heard the passage from revelation 

 	    whoever adds to the sacred words of this book   whoever removes
 	 words from this book        

 	 I feel this is ridiculous for two reasons 

    good reasons deleted   AI 

 	If one takes the translation of  this book  in REV        or somewhere
 	around there  to mean  all of scripture   then all of us are likely
 	holding something that is in violation of this command 

It s even worse than that   

 Ye shall not add unto the word which I 
command you  neither shall ye diminish 
from it   Deut       
Shall we rip out every page from our 
Bibles beginning from Joshua through
Revelation
