There are a number of Philosophical questions that I would like to ask 

    If we encounter a life form during our space exploration  how do we
determine if we should capture it  imprison it  and then discect it 

    If we encounter a civilization that is suffering economicly  will
we expend resources from earth to help them 

    With all of the deseases we currently have that are deadly and undetectable 
what will be done to ensure that more new deadly deseases aren t brought
back  or that our deseases don t destroy life elsewhere 



   
Have a day
