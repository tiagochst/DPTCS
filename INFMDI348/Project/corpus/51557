  I m in the market for a Post script compatible laser writer   My needs
  are pretty modest so     dpi    pages a minute would be just fine 
  My budget is also pretty modest  so inexpensive would also be good 
  It will be working from a single mac  but networkability would 
  probably be a good investment for the future 
 
  With that in mind   
 
     Anyone have comments about the suitability quality value of a GCC
  BLP Elite printer 

I just recently purchased the GCC BLP Elite and I really like it   My
needs
are much the same as what you describe   In addition  I wanted to get one
that
I could access via AppleTalk  so that eliminated the new line of
inexpensive 
printers from Apple   The print quality is good to excellent based on
what 
font you re using and what paper you use   I m still experimenting with 
different papers  but a medium grade laser printer paper seems to work
fine 

Printing envelopes  transpariencies  letter head  or other single feed
jobs is
very easy   There is an adjustable  automatic centering  guide on top of
the
sheet feeder which aligns the paper properly  and doesn t feed a sheet
from
the sheet feeder  as some do  

 I have no affiliation with GCC  just a satisfied customer
