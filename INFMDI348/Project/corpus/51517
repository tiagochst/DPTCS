A quick query for Powerbook gurus 
Tom Spearman  in a post on alternative Powerbook battery options
mentioned that there exist   versions of their Powerbook        
batteries  a     amp hour one  M     A   a     amp hour one 
 M     B  and a     amp hour one  M     C   Anyone out there
know how to determine which of these a battery is  I looked at my
battery and there is no obvious exterior indication  I contacted
Tom Spearman who had gleaned the information from MacUser and he
didn t know either  Anyone out there know the answer 
	Thanks
