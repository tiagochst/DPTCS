    Could anyone enlighten me on how the Mormon church views 
children born out of wedlock   In particular I m interested to know if any 
stigma is attached to the children as opposed to the parents   I m especially 
keen to learn if there is or is not any prohibition in the Mormon faith on 
bastards entering heaven or having their names entered in the big genealogical 
book the Mormons keep in Salt Lake City   If this is an issue on which the 
 official  position has changed over time  I m interested in learning both old 
and new beliefs   E mail or posting is fine   All information or pointers are 
appreciated
