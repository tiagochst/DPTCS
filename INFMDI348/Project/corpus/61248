George William Herbert sez 

 Hmm      billion  lesse    I can probably launch     tons to LEO at
      million  in five years  which gives about    tons to the lunar
 surface one way   Say five tons of that is a return vehicle and its
 fuel  a bigger Mercury or something  might get that as low as two
 tons   leaving fifteen tons for a one man habitat and a year s supplies 
 Gee  with that sort of mass margins I can build the systems off
 the shelf for about another hundred million tops   That leaves
 about      million profit   I like this idea      Let s see
 if you guys can push someone to make it happen        

I like your optimism  George   I don t know doots about raising that kind
of dough  but if you need people to split the work and the     M  you just
give me a ring      Living alone for a year on the moon sounds horrid  but
I d even try that  if I got a bigger cut
