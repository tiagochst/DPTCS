   In answer
  to a question from Hawking  Chahine described a proposed
  drag free satellite  but confirmed that at this point   it s only
  a concept  
 
 SO what s a drag free satellite    coated with WD    


     TRIAD  the first drag free satellite  was designed and built by the 
Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and launched   Sept        The 
satellite was in three sections separated by two booms   The central section 
housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System  which consisted of a proof 
mass of special non magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity   The 
proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit  free from drag and radiation 
pressure   Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered 
around the proof mass  thereby flying the entire satellite drag free 

     TRIAD was one of the APL designed Navy Navigation Satellites   The 
 nd generation operational navigation satellites flying today  NOVA  use a 
single axis version of DISCOS   TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be 
powered by an RTG  APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space  in       

     Further info on TRIAD  DISCOS  etc  can be found in  Spacecraft Design
