How hard or easy would it be to have a combo mission such as a solar sail on
the way out to the outer planets  but once in near to orbit to use more normal
means  
Seems that everyone talks about using one system and one system only per
mission  why not have more than one propulsion system  Or did I miss
something      or did it die in committee
