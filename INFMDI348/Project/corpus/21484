Like we have never heard of  or read these verses before 

How about you read them in context  taking into consideration the times and 
places in which they were written  the local customs and pagan rituals  
what the surrounding verses are talking about and how they interact with 
the rest of the Bible 

There are many issues in the Bible that are argued  and can be argued 
successfullly from both sides of an issue   Some examples that come to mind
are 
		Gifts of the Spirit
		when the Rapture will occur pre or post tribulation 
		how people should be baptized
to name a few 

I have found nothing in scripture that condemns me  or anyone else  for having
a monogamous relationship with the person whom I love  even if we are the
same sex 

I m sorry if I am coming across as heated   It s just that the Lord has been
so dear to me the last several years and I m tired of hearing this same old
thing from people who believe what their told rather than finding out for 
themselves 

Check it out for yourself   Invite the Holy Spirit to guide you   If I weren t
confident of this I wouldn t invite you to do this 

God Bless
