   My opinion is that the strong atheist position requires too much
   belief for me to be comfortable with  Any strong atheists out there
   care to comment  
      
  Humans just come up with the idea of a spiritual parent  It is one
  of the artifacts of human thought  The evidence for that is quite
  overwhelming  And the information content of the conceived is vanishing 
   
  In other words  if there were gods  they would hardly make sense  and
  it is possible to explain the phenomenon of religion without gods 
   
  The concept is useless  and I don t have to introduce new assumptions
  in order to show that 
   
  No leap of faith required for me  Your mileage may vary 

Yes I fully agree with that  but is it  I don t believe gods exist   or
 I believe no gods exist   As MANDTBACKA FINABO ABO FI  Mats Andtbacka 
pointed out  it all hinges on what you take the word  believe  to mean 

Unfortunately this is bound up in the definitions of strong and weak
atheism  at least according to the FAQ 

  Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God 
  Some atheists go further  and believe that God does not exist   The former is
  often referred to as the  weak atheist  position  and the latter as  strong
  atheism  
  
  It is important to note the difference between these two positions    Weak
  atheism  is simple scepticism  disbelief in the existence of God    Strong
  atheism  is a positive belief that God does not exist   Please do not
  fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are  strong atheists  

 From mathew s  An Introduction to Atheism  version     last modified   Apr    

Should the FAQ be clarified to try to pin down this notion of  belief  
Can it
