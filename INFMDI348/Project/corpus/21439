In article       athos rutgers edu  david s hsr no  David A  Sjoen  writes 
  Personally  I think that Christians shouldn t fight 

     As Christians  we are not supposed to defend ourselves
  	Matt          Heb         
     War is a result of sin  Defense may be a necessary reaction to an
  attack  but I don t think that we as Christians should take part in
  this 


What if you are trying to defend someone else   Should you allow killing and
oppression to continiue  or is it our obligation to protect the innocent
