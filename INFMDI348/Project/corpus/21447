In article  May                       athos rutgers edu   you write 
   
    Yes   My comments were long enough that I don t want to repeat
   them here  but I ll send them via email back to the author 
   Certainly it was not intended to be a description of three similar
   deities  though I certainly see why it would look that way 
   
Thanks for the letter  your comments helped some 

As to the last comment  I certainly realize that it was not intended to
sound that way   I am still trying to understand  how  a spiritual being
colud truly be one and three at the same time   All of the descriptions
of this are either Platonic or sound like special pleading  sort of 
 they appear to be three seperate beings in all ways  but really they are
one  trust me   

Neither of these is acceptible to me 

The fact is  so far the only descriptions of the trinity that makes any
 sense  to me are the modalistic ones  such as Modalistic Monarchianism
or  Economic Trinitarianism     I can accept that the three aspects are
intrinsic to the nature of God  so I perhaps lean more towards the latter  

I am trying  here  to see if anybody can come up with another description
that is both orthodox and believable

 I fear orthodox theologians have been overly in love with paradox  to
the extent that well meaning people think they ve just flat out
confused   There s no problem with things being both   and    e g   if
the   are different parts of the     Father  Son  and Holy Spirit
aren t exactly parts of God  because parts are things distinguished by
physical separation   All three Persons are omnipresent  so they are
obviously aren t physically separate   But they re in some way
different aspects  modes  or whatever  of one God   If you accept
economic trinitarianism  it s possible that you don t have any
substantive difference with the standard view   Is it possible that
you just don t find the neo Platonic explanation illuminating
