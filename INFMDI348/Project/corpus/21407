Nabil Ayoub writes 

 As a final note  the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign a
 common statement of Christology  in which the heresey of  Monophysitism
was condemned  So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not  believe in
Monophysitism 

Sorry 

What does the Coptic Church believe about the will and energy of Christ 
 Were there one or were there two  i e  Human and Divine  wills and
energies in Him 

Also  what is the objection ot the Copts with the Pope of Rome  i e  why
is there a Coptic Catholic Church    Do you reject the supreme
jurisdiction of the    rd sucessor of St  Peter  who blessed St  John
Mark  Bishop of Alexandria was translator for  and his predecessors   Or
his infallibility   Or what other things perhaps
