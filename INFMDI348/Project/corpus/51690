Hello fellow humans  and other net creatures   
 
If you re at all interested in this merchandise  please e mail me

I m compacting my system and moving to a single monitor system  so I have
two monitors and cards for sale  Nothing at all is wrong with these pieces 
I m just wanting to conserve desk space  and get all of my info from one
screen 
 
I d prefer to sell to people near Austin and surrounding areas  within
driving distance   like an hour away perhaps   but I CAN ship to you if you
don t live near here  Only problem is that I didn t keep the original boxes
for the monitors  but I m confident that my few months of full time service
in the shipping room will enable me to safely package the monitors and
flip it in your direction 
 
Details 
 
Mirror Full Page Display  monochrome  w nubus card 
                                                   
 
  SOLD  
 
Sony          color monitor 
                            
What s to say  It got top ratings in last year s MacUser report  It s a SONY 
Trinitron  arguably the best  but I d rather not argue that point  
It s a great monitor  in great shape  but I m going to a bigger screen 
and although I d like to keep it  finances don t justify it 
 
Still selling for      at MacLand  where I bought it originally   not
including shipping   will sell for           plus shipping   Again  make an
offer if that sounds unreasonable 
 
 
RasterOps   si     bit accelerated  hardware zoom pan    meg RAM  
                                                                  
Renamed the   sx a few months after I bought it  this board is for    
monitors  providing   accelerated    bit    hardware zoom pan  NTSC mode
 you can plug it into something like the RasterOps Video Expander and output
NTSC   and   RAM slots that use   meg or   meg SIMMS for GWorld RAM  or a
RAM disk  Software included for such functions    meg of RAM included    meg
SIMMS  
 
Selling for      at Bottom Line  without the RAM   add        I m asking
          shipping included this time  it s just a card   Original box and
packaging  I d actually prefer to sell the Sony monitor and this card
together  so if you want both  drop me e mail and make a  bundled offer 
for these items 
 
            
 
Cheers
