  I recently purchased a Centris     and a Mirror Technologies    inch
  Mono monitor   I m wondering if it is OK to set the monitor on top
  of the CPU   The monitor weighs    lbs 
 
  I ve called Apple   The person I spoke with was not sure but was
  going to find out and call me back in a couple of days   That was
  over a week ago    
 
  If anybody knows  please respond via email as I don t always have time
  to read this group   Thanks

Yea  thanks to lots of good information in this newsgroup  I was prepared
for lots of details  even shipping time     got my C          CD in   weeks  
I guess my biggest disappointment is the lack of detail in the written
specs and documentation   The case load spec is an example    the setup
section says Apple     and     monitors can go on top  but     and other
big ones can t   Why couldn t they publish a maximum load 

Now if I can figure out if there s any hope using the  partition  button
on the hard disk setup utility  do I dare just try it and see what happens   
then maybe I can divide up the wealth among the family members a bit more
securly   The  getting more information  section of the manual suggested
trying other avenues before calling Apple  but didn t mention the net
