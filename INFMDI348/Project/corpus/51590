Hi all   

I have a IIsi with a floppy drive that might be bad  and might just be out
of alignment  I haven t checked yet        If the drive is not easily
reparable  I d like to replace it with an  internal  floptical   Can this
be easily done   Can it be done at all   

I m assuming that floptical drives can read and write both    k and    k
floppies   If this is not in fact true  please tell me 

Thanks in advance 
          Kiran
