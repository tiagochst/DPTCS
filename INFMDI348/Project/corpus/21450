Without quoting at length from the preceeding post  I d just like
to say that I find it a much more appropriate way of dealing with
issues like the Holocaust and Bosnia that asserting that  God is
punishing them  

The activity of God is always  redemptive   which means  restoring
what has been lost  broken  or distorted    So  God does not  will 
the brokenness  lostness  distortion  genocide  poverty  etc  but
is nonetheless capable  willing  and active to restore  heal  mend 
and redeeem
