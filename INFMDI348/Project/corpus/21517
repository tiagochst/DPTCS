    How do you feel about groups like Diecide  Slayer  and Dio who
freely admit to practicing satanism and preach it in their songs 


    How do you feel about groups like Petra  old Stryper  Whitecross 
and Holy Soldier who promote and sing about Cristianity 


    How do you feel about groups like Front      XTC  Revolting Cocks 
Minor Threat  and Ministry who condone and sing about atheism 


    How do you feel about bands like Shelter who preach the Hare
Krishna religion and other minority but not unheard of  religions 


  a  Do you feel there is any difference between promoting music that
supports Cristianity and music that condones satanism 

  b  Why do you feel this way 


    What types of music do you listen to 


  a  How often do you purchase music 

  b  How often does that music contain lyrics with undertones in
religion 


  a  Do you feel that music one listens to affects the way one views
a particular religion  Religion in general 

  b  How does it affect the way you view your religion  All religions
