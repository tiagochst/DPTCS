In article   rgvjsINNbhq senator bedfellow MIT EDU   jfc athena mit edu  John F Carr  writes 
  
  If gamma ray bursters are extragalactic  would absorption from the
  galaxy be expected   How transparent is the galactic core to gamma
  rays 
  
  How much energy does a burster put out   I know energy depends on
  distance  which is unknown   An answer of the form  X  ergs per
  megaparsec   is OK

        I had to turn to one of my problem sets that I did in class for this
little problem   I don t have a calculator  but I DO have the problem set that
we did not too long ago  so I ll use that  and hope it s what you wanted   
This is a highly simplified problem  with a very simple burst   Bursts are
usually more complex than this example I will use here 
        Our burst has a peak flux of     E   ergs cm    sec    and a duration
of      seconds   During the frst second of the burst  and the last   seconds 
its flux is half of the peak flux   It s flux is the peak flux the rest of the
time   Assume that the background flux is   E   erg cm    sec    
        Then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst  for several
different spheres  R    pc Oort Cloud Radius   R     pc at the edge of the
galaxy   R      pc or the edge of the galactic corona  and lastly at a
R     Mpc   
        We integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence  then used the
old standby formula 
                        Luminosity   pi  r   Fpeak
        For a radius of     pc  we found an L around       erg sec   Pretty
energetic for close by   for the coronal model  we found around       erg sec 
And lastly  for the cosmological model an L        That s what you d call
moderately energetic  I d say   Any suggestions about what could put out that
much energy in one second
