Although the    billion scheme is a fantasy  it s an old canard in the space
business called  trolling for billionaires    there is a good chance that a
much smaller program      million  will pass the    rd Congress  This is the
Back to the Moon bill  put together by the people who passed the Launch
Services Purchase Act  The bill would incent private companies to develop
lunar orbiters  with vendors selected on the basis of competitive bidding 
There is an aggregate cap on the bids of     million 
 
Having a single rich individual paying billions for lunar missions is probably
worse than having the government bankroll a     million program  as the Delta
Clipper program has shown  DC X was funded by SDIO at     million   We have a
clear chance of making a lunar mission happen in this decade   as opposed to
simply wishing for our dreams to come true  Please support the Back to the
Moon bill
