  We are doing heavy   duty image processing with some seriously
  underpowered Mac s  Mac IIsi  for example    Most of the CPU time is
  burned in doing FFT s 
  
  What cards are out there which would allow us to take away that part
  of the load from the CPU   Any DSP       or i    cards out there 
  for example   They d have to be callable from Think Pascal  to
  replace the one   and two   dimensional FFT s routines in an already
  existing program 

Check out the National Instruments NB DSP      This uses the Texas
Instruments TMS   C   chip  which is a true    bit floating point DSP  It s
pricey  however
