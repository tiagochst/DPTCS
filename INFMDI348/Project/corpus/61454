  Being wierd again  so be warned 

Being what   Oh   weird    OK  I m warned 

  Is there a plan to put a satellite around each planet in the solar system to
  keep watch  I help it better to ask questions before I spout an opinion 

Keep watch for what 

  How about a mission  unmanned  to Pluto to stay in orbit and record things
  around and near and on Pluto   I know it is a strange idea  but why not  

Oh  the several tens  or hundreds  of millions of dollars it would cost
to  record things  there   And I d prefer a manned mission  anyway 

  It could do some scanning of not only Pluto  but also of the solar system 
  objects near and aaroundpluto  as well as SETI and looking at the galaxy
  without having much of the solar system to worry about  

We ve already got a pretty good platform to  scan  the solar
system  as well as SETI and looking at the galaxy without having
much of the solar system to worry about  
Care to guess where it is
