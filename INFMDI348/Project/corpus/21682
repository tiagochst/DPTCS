 Let me say that the life  death  and resurrection of Jesus Christ is
 central to Christianity  If you personally believe that Jesus Christ
 died for you  you are a part of the Christian body of believers 

 We are all still human  We don t know it all  but homosexual or heterosexual 
 we all strive to follow Jesus   The world is dying and needs to hear about
 Jesus Christ 

 Are you working together with other Christians to spread the Gospel 

Let me salute Gary Chin for speaking the gospel which is our source
of life   Any who will follow his example  and accept the priorities
Christ commands of us  that the weightier matters of the law are justice
and mercy and good faith  is my brother or sister in Christ  and I will
attend to such a person with humility and charity   We may not  in the
end  agree    siblings often don t    but we can at least talk
