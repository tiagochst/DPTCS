	I too am interested in peoples  experience with accelerators for the
SE   Is an accelerator the best route to improve performace in my SE  or should
I consider upgrading to an SE    motherboard   Obviously  buying a new mac 
would be ideal  but alas  I only have enough money for an accelerator or
motherboard 
	E mail reply preferred   Thanks
