In article   rmh eINN  h gap caltech edu  kwp wag caltech edu  Kevin W  Plaxco  writes 

  resolving power of the optics   BATSE is an altogether different
  beast  effectively just   coincidence counters  one on each corner of 
  the craft   Positional information is triangulated from the 
  differential signal arrival times at each of the detectors 

Obviously not   Count rates are too low and signal rise times too long
for this to be possible   The CGRO  is  what     meters long   You d
need to time to an accuracy of nanoseconds to do this 

What BATSE actually does is measure the relative strength in each of
the detectors  also as a function of photon energy    Each of the
detectors does not have isotropic response   To do this right one must
model the scattering of photons in the material around each detector 
and even scattering of photons off the Earth s atmosphere back onto
the spacecraft   I believe they have now reduced the error to about  
degrees
