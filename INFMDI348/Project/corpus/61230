As for SF and advertising in space  There is a romantic episode
in Mead s  The Big Ball of Wax  where the lovers are watching 
the constellation Pepsi Cola rising over the horizon and noting
the some  stars  had slipped cause the Teamsters were on strike 

This was the inspiration for my article on orbiting a formation
of space mirrors published in Spaceflight in       As the reviews
said  this seems technically feasible  and could be commercially viable
but is it aesthetically desirable   These days the only aesthetics
that count are the ones you can count
