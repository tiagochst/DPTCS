  getting at here   This puppy is far enough away  that if a bright
  burst happens nearby  the huge annulus created by it will hopefully
  intersect the line or general circle given by BATSE  and we can get a
  moderately accurate position  Say oh    or   degrees  That is the
  closest anyone has ever gotten with it 


You can do a whole hell of a lot better than   or   degrees with
the differential timing measurements from the interplanetary network 
Ignore the directional information from BATSE  just look at the time
of arrival   With three detectors properly arranged  one can often
get positions down to  arc minutes 

BTW  about Oort cloud sources  shouldn t this be testable in the
fairly near future   Some of the GRBs have very short rise times     
ms    We could detect the curvature of the burst wavefront out to a
distance of on the order of b    t c  where b is the detector spacing
and t the time resolution   For t     ms and b     AU  this is on the
order of    light years   I understand statistics will reduce this
number considerably  as would geometry if the burst is coming from the
wrong direction
