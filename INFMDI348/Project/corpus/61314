In article  C  o t A o zoo toronto edu  henry zoo toronto edu  Henry Spencer  writes 
 Does anyone have a reference  something I can look up  not just your own
 recollections    I have a few of those myself  on the temperature of the
  night  sky as seen from space 
 
 Note  I am  not  talking about the temperature of the Microwave Background
 Radiation   There are more things in the sky than just the MBR  what I m
 after is total blackbody temperature    what a thermal radiator would see 
 disregarding  or shielding against  the Sun and nearby large warm objects 
 My dim recollection is that the net effective temperature is substantially
 higher than that of the MBR  once you figure in things like stars and the
 zodiacal light  but I d like numbers 
    
 SVR  resembles a high speed collision     Henry Spencer   U of Toronto Zoology

It s not quite what you were asking  but a few years ago I helped some EE
remote sensing people run some experiments on the microwave emmissivity of
ice  they used the sky for a background calibration source   They said that
from Earth s surface the sky looks like a   K blackbody
