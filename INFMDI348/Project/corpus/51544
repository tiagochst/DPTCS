      This is a posting for my friend who does not have USENET access         
      Please contact him  not me  directly  thank you                         

   The Mac II is supposed to have a socket for the MC      PMMU chip  Could
anyone let me know where that socket is on the motherboard  I have obtained
a PMMU chip     Mhz  from a surplus store  and would like to install it onto
my Mac II  circa        But I cannot see the socket myself when I tried to
install it 

   Could anyone send me the pinouts for the Mac II SCSI DB    interface 


Thank you
