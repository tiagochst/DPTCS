Why can t an aircraft be designed so that the pilot can always be 
maintained in a upright position  perpendicular to the plane of
acceleration   With the visual helmets now being used that display
some of the flight parameters and with a keyboard and manuvering
equipment moving with the pilot  a pilot may be able to function at
accelerations in excess of   G   Is anyone currently pursuing this
area or is there a reason why this is impossible at the present time
