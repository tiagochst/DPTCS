I am seeking recommendations Vendors for a Networkable FAX  It would
mainly be used for outgoing FAX s from Mac s on our Net  The ability
to Fax from other platforms would be a plus  Ethernet interface would
be preffered but LocalTalk would suffice  Can anyone provide any info 
Thanks in advance    Peter
