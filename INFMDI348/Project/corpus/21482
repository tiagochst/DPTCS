In article  May                       athos rutgers edu   Eugene Bigelow ebay sun com  Geno   writes 
       Nothing unclean shall enter  heaven    Rev          Therefore 
  babies are born in such a state that should they die  they are cuf off
  from God and put in hell  which is exactly the doctrine of St  Augustine
  and St  Thomas   

I haven t read this entire thread  but  if someone hasn t tossed this out yet  then here it is  

  Samuel           RSV    

   Then his servants said to him   What is this thing that you have
  done  You fasted and wept for the child while it was alive  but when
  the child died  you arose and ate food   He  David  said   While the
  child was still alive  I fasted and wept  for I said   Who knows
  whether the LORD will be gracious to me  that the child may live   But
  now he is dead  why should I fast  Can I bring him back again  I shall
  go to him  but he will not return to me   

Anyhow  many interpret this to mean that the child has gone to Heaven
 where David will someday go   I don t claim to know for sure if this
applies to all babies or not  But even if it s just this one  what
would you say to this
