   Hm  maybe I m missing something  but the Centris     has the      with FPU 
   At least the ones shipped here in Europe 
  
  You are indeed  The      model  shipped here  definitely does not have the
  FPU  I own one  I know 


No  he s not missing anything   You re right that some models of the     ship in
the USA without FPU or Ethernet   Per Ejeklint is also right     all   I repeat 
 ALL  Centris     s sold here in New Zealand and  I assume  Europe have the FPU
and Ethernet 

I know   I bought a          and it has both FPU and Ethernet
