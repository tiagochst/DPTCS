  Does anyone have a reference  something I can look up  not just your own
  recollections    I have a few of those myself  on the temperature of the
   night  sky as seen from space 

The temperature of intergalactic space  or intercluster or 
intersupercluster space  would be very  very close to the microwave 
background temperature       kelvins   I recall that in interstellar 
space in our neighborhood of the galaxy it s something like   K 

Is that what you were looking for
