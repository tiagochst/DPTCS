  you can find retail that is within the price of a keyboard of educational
  prices  

I would be very wary of retail outlets selling as cheap as educational prices 
I went for a retailer  actually mail order  CDA computers   because its price
was better thant the campus computer store  I found out why later on when I
tried to get a repair done at an Apple registered repair center   the CPU was a
resale  The serial number had been removed and replaced with a non standard
number  probably from CDA computers   Consequently  the Apple repair man could
not do ANY warrenty repairs  So I ended up with just a   day warrenty from CDA
over the Apple   month warrenty  Boy  was I pi  ed  Moral of the story  CAVEAT
EMPTOR 

However  if you go with a reliable  trustworthy mail order firm  if they exist
  maybe someone could enlighten us with their experiences   you will probably
get a better price than your local educational outlet simply because mail order
out of state does not REQUIRE sales tax yet  Though for how much longer remains
to be seen  The addition in sales tax on a CPU purchase will probably wipe out
an educational discount  Again CAVEAT EMPTOR  some mail order companies DO
include sales tax on purchases even if they are out of state  so check
