    Why do you spend so much time posting here if your atheism is so
    incidental  if the question of God is trivial  Fess up  it matters to
    you a great deal 
 
 Ask yourself two questions 
 
 	     How important is Mithras in your life today 
 
 	     How important would Mithras become if there was a
 	     well funded group of fanatics trying to get the
 	     schools system to teach your children that Mithras
 	     was the one true God

Right on  Jon   Who cares who or whose  as long as it works for the individual 
But don t try to impose those beliefs on us or our children   I would add the
well funded group tries also to purge science  to deny children access to great
wonders and skills   And how about the kids born to creationists   What a
burden with which to begin adult life   It must be a cruel awakening for those
who finally see the light  provided it is possible to escape from the depths of
this type of ignorance
