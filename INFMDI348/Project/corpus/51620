 Similarly  I have trained myself to hold down the RIGHT HAND pair of
 command option for desktop rebuilds 

I tried the right set and it didn t work   I m on the phone to their
tech support right now and the guys doesn t know what a desktop
rebuild is     He s got me holding for someone else               
And holding  and holding  and holding 

Ok they finally got back to me and said basically  it should work  
Well it doens t and they don t know why   Guess it will go back to
MacConnection and I ll buy something else   I ve got better things
to do than play musical keyboards
