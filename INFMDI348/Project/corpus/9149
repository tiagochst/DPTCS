    I ve just bought a PC which came with a bundle of Lotus stuff  including
    Adobe Type Manager version       As a newcomer to Windows  I m
    confused about which I should be using  ATM or Truetype  
  
  If you are going to stay with ATM  be sure to upgrade to      which
  replaces      Who knows how old      is       is as fast as TT  and if
  you disable the small screen fonts  ATM does better screen rendering at
  the smaller point sizes 

Not true  Both Type   and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality
at any size  It all depends on the font s maker and the complexity of the glyphs
related to the size and resolution at which they are viewed  Probably the reason
for your opinion experience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the
market today have been converted from Type   outlines to TT either by the font
vendor or end users using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being
hand hinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language  At best these converted
TT fonts will be on a par with the Type   font of its orgin 

TrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type    the hinting
of diagonals for instance  which TT does and Type   cannot   If you check out the
Windows     core fonts  Times  Arial  Courier  Symbol  Wingdings  you ll see what can
be done with TT  There are other fonts out there that have been hand hinted and not
just converted  Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack   fonts are hinted very well 

  You can use both TT and ATM fonts at the same time  if you like 
  ATM  Type    fonts tend to be of higher quality
  and be more complete in terms of foreign characters 

Again  not true  The characters in a TT or Type   font depend on the maker  If someone
converts a Type   font to TT they ll only get the characters in the font of orgin  TT
allows for much more flexibility in this area as well  You can have thousands of glyphs
in a TT font file  Mac PS Windows Unicode char set  and use the characters appropriate
for the particular platform you are running the font on  For instance  all or our fontpack
  TT fonts have the Mac Windows char set in them  The metrics of the fonts are such that
if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set
