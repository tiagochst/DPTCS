 Someone asked about Biblical support for the image of Satan as
a fallen angel   Rev        and Enoch have been cited     clh 

There is also a verse in Luke    that says He Jesus  saw Satan fall
from Heaven   It s something like that   I don t have my Bible in
front of me or I would quote it directly  but it s a pretty obvious
reference to Satan s expulsion 

Justin

 I believe the reference is to Luke         The context of the passage
makes it possible that Jesus is referring to Satan being defeated by
Jesus  mission  rather than a previous fall from heaven     clh
