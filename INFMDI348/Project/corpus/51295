   Then what would it have to do with  in the universe    You theists
   cannot understand that inside the universe and outside the universe
   are two different places   Put God outside the universe and you
   subtract from it the ability to interact with the inside of the
   universe  put it inside the universe and you impose the rules of
   physics on it 
 
     God is outside the universe 
     Things outside the universe do not have  the ability to interact
     with the inside of the universe  
     Therefore God cannot interact inside the universe 
 
     has no basis whatsoever   You seem to have positive knowledge
 about this 

	    is a corrallary of     

	The negation of     would contridict     

 
   Although we do not have a complete model of the physical rules
   governing the inside of the universe  we expect that there are no
   contradictory events likely to destroy the fabric of modern physics 
   On the other hand  your notion of an omnipotent  omniscient and
   infinitely benevolent god  is not subject to physical laws  you
   attempt to explain this away by describing it as being outside of
   them  beyond measurement   To me  beyond measurement means it can
   have no measurable effect on reality  so it cannot interact  ergo 
   your god is IRRELEVANT 
 
     God is beyond measure 
     Beyond measurement means it can have no measurable effect on
     reality 
     Therefore God cannot have a measurable effect on reality 
 
     has no basis whatsoever

        Satan and the Angels do not have freewill   
        They do what god tells them to do
