Michael Siemon writes 

 Furthermore  it is inaccurate to say that the Reformers  threw out  these
 books   Basically  they just placed them in a secondary status  as Jerome
 had already done   but with the additional warning that doctrine should
 not be based on citations from these ALONE 

Protestants love to play up Jerome for all he is worth  They should
remeber that after the Decree of Pope St  Damsus I  Jerome did not
hesitate in accpeting the deuteroncanon  and quoted them as Scripture in
his later writings   And as I have already pointed out  in a previous
letter on this subject  the Catholic Church has accepted the
deuterocanon from the beginning   And the Protestants in the      s all
of a sudden revived the old theory of some  condemned by Pope  Council 
and Church  that the deuterocanon were not inspired 

Again  why must the Church of Jesus Christ adopt the canon of the
unbelieving Jews  drawn up in Jamnia in    AD  in countering the
Christian use of the Septuagint
