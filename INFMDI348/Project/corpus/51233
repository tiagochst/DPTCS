 Let me see if I understand what you are saying   In order to talk 
 knowledgeably about religion  Atheists must first have been so immersed 
 in a religion that only the rare individual could have left   

No  you don t understand   I said that I don t think people can discuss
the subjective merits of religion objectively   This should be obvious 
People here have said that everyone would be better off without religion 
but this almost certainly isn t true 

  But really  are you threatened by the motto  or by the people that use it 
 The motto is a tool   Let s try to take away the tool 

But  guns and axes are tools  both of which have been used for murder 
Should both be taken away   That is to say  I don t think motto misuse
warrants its removal   At least not in this case
