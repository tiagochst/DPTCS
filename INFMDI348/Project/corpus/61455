  It has been known for quite a while that the earth is actually more pear
  shaped than globular spherical   Does anyone make a  globe  that is accurate
  as to actual shape  landmass configuration Long Lat lines etc  
 
 I don t think you re going to be able to see the differences from a sphere
 unless they are greatly exaggerated   Even the equatorial bulge is only
 about   part in        you d never notice a  mm error in a   cm globe   
 and the other deviations from spherical shape are much smaller

I remember a physic prof  who talked about scaling a cue ball to Earth size 
Its was significantly less spherical that the Earth
