 Well  I was certainly turned off by that first paragraph of oft used
 platitudes  I can t count the times I ve heard those common tactics
 anymore    you may not believe it but that doesn t change the fact
 that it s true    the old analogy about trusting your parents   sheesh 
 Need I point out how parents can show children that they are right 
 That difference in capability alone crushes that analogy  as any  facts 
 about Christianity I have seen turned out to be beliefs  What I seek is
 fact  knowledge  if I can get it  and evidence for a belief if I can t 
 So far from Christians I have received neither   

Before becoming a Christian I too had problems when I asked one to explain
it to me   The actual evidence is not always what you see on a person s 
outside  It should be but is not always 
	A very specific  somewhat miraculous example of the truth of God
working to help His followers is soemthing that happened to me  For nearly
  years after an accident I had severe complications from a triple 
fracture in my left leg and surgery  pins put in  then removed  The bone 
itself was perfectly healed  No infectoin that could be detected  Yet I 
was in constant pain and it my ankle and foot were always swollen and
bluish  More complicatios developed in my other leg  none of which could
be explained by the best specialists and most sophisticated tests in te
northern Illinois region  We went everywhere  no one could explain it 
Durin gthat summer  June          to be exact  I gave my life and heart
to Christ and vowed to relinquish control over my life  which i never
really had anyway  because of what he did for me on the cross and the 
fact that my whole life was screwed up by me trying to fix it  I was facing
the possibility of a lifetime in a wheelchair  I was confined to one in 
order to save my legs from any further damage since the cause of my problems
were unknown  had been in it for about       months before that day  
	I found it ore than coincidental that less than   weeks after
I put my faith where my mouth was  one more in the long line of doctors
and not even an orthopeodic specialist  diagnosed my problems with no
difficulty  set me on the path to an effective cure  and I was walking
and running again without the pain that had stopped me from that for
  years  The diagnosis was something he felt the other doctors must have
 overlooked  because it was perfectly obvious from my test results 
	Maybe this doesn t hit you as miraculous  But to me it really
is  Imagine an active    year old being told she may not be able to
walk mcuh longer   and is now a happy    year old who can dance and run
knowing that the problem was there all along and was  revealed  just
after she did what she knew was right  As the song says   
	 Our God is an awesome God
