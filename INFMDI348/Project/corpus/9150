     Yes  and it is the fastest defrag I ve ever watched   It did a    MB 
     hard disk in    minutes 
    
    	I found the MS defrag looks very much like Norton Speedisk 
    Is it just a strip down version of the later 
    
    	I have both Norton Speedisk and Backup  so I was wondering 
    if I need to install MS Backup

 Yes  defragger IS come from Norton 
 If you have Norton Utility  don t bother 


     Don t bother if you have CPBackup or Fastback   They all offer options 
not available in the stripped down MS version  FROM CPS     Examples   no 
proprietary format  to save space   probably no direct DMA access  and no 
tape drive 

     You NEED MS Defrag if you use doublespace to work on the compressed 
volume
