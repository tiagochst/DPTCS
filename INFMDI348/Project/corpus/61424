Regarding the feasability of retrieving the HST for repair and
relaunching it 

 Caution  speculation mode engaged 
There is another consideration that hasn t been mentioned yet 
I expect that retrieving HST would involve  damaging  it considerably in
order to return it to its cradle in the cargo bay   Most of the deployed
items  antennas and  especially  the solar arays  probably are not
retractable into their fully stowed position  even by hand   They would
have to be removed by the astronauts    The only advantage that this
might yield is that we could put new panels on that don t  ring  due
to thermal cycle stresses    

I also expect that  as has been discussed  the landing loads on the
HST optics structure is a big issue  but that the reentry loads are
much less so    Can the moveable optical components even be re caged
 I assume that they were caged for launch
