   SOmebody mentioned  a re boost of HST during this mission   meaning
   that Weight is a very tight  margin on this  mission 
    

I haven t heard any hint of a re boost  or that any is needed 

   
   why not  grapple   do all said fixes    bolt a small  liquid  fueled
   thruster module  to  HST    then let it make the re boost   it has to be
   cheaper on mass then usingthe shuttle as a tug    

Nasty  dirty combustion products   People have gone to monumental efforts to
keep HST clean   We certainly aren t going to bolt any thrusters to it
