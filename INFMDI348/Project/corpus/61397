	Sorry  I ve lost track of who asked the question originally 
	 our news server at GSFC keeps things around for tremendously
	short periods of time   but wanted to be certain before I
	replied  Someone asked about displaying the compressed images
	from the Voyager imaging CD ROMs on a Mac  As Peter Ford  MIT 
	pointed out  a decompression program is available via FTP 
	 Sorry  I don t remember the name of the node offhand  
	although it s  mit edu   In any case  though  one of the MAC
	display programs  CD ROM Browser by Dana Swift  does display
	the compressed images directly  The program is shareware and
	is distributed by NSSDC for nominal reproduction costs      
	shipping  if memory serves   This does  not  cover the
	shareware price which should go to Dana for his diligent work
	and upgrades  however 

	To request current pricing information  information about
	available display software  catalogs  or data from NSSDC
