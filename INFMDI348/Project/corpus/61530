    Why not build a inflatable space dock 

 discussion of pros and cons deleted 

 These are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal
 for an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of
 success 

Could someone give me the references to the LLNL proposal   I ve been meaning
to track it down in conjuntion with something I m working on   It s not 
directly related to space stations  but I think many of the principles will 
carry over
