Several people have enquired about the availability of the book about the
Great     reflector built at Birr Castle  Ireland in      which remained the
largest in the world until the the start of the   th century 

 The Astronomy of Birr Castle  was written by Patrick Moore who now sits on
the committee which is going to restore the telescope   The remains are on
public display all year round   the massive support walls  the    foot long
tube  and other bits and pieces   This book is the definitivie history of
how one man  the Third Earl of Rosse  pulled off the most impressive
technical achievement  perhaps ever  in the history of the telescope  and
the discoveries made with the instrument 

Patrick Moore is donating all proceeds from the book s sale to help restore
the telescope  Astronomy Ireland is making the book available world wide by
mail order  It s a fascinating read and by ordering a copy you bring the day
when we can all look through it once again that little bit nearer
