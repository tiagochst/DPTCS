 In article      Apr                waikato ac nz   I said 
   I know that plugging and unplugging ADB devices with the power on is  not
   supported   and you can hit problems if you have multiple devices with
   clashing addresses  and all that 

 I ve had a couple of e mail responses from people who seem to believe that
 this sort of thing is not only unsupported  it is downright dangerous 
 
 I have heard of no such warnings from anybody at Apple  Just to be sure  I
 asked a couple of our technicians  one of whom has been servicing Macs for
 years  There is  no  danger of damaging logic boards by plugging and unplugging
 ADB devices with the power on 

Noooooooo   I ve been servicing Macs for years too  and I ve had to
repair a number of motherboards that had been damaged this way   It s
rare  but it does happen 

Mind you  this doesn t mean you shouldn t do it   The parts that can
blow  the ADB power fuse and RF filter  aren t too expensive  so IF you
have a someone around who can do component level repair  it may be worth
the risk  especially if you re around Seattle   cause you might get to
pay  me  to fix it         On the other hand  if your only repair option
is the Apple standard logic board swap  major        you should probably
play it safe 

 SCSI  yes  ADB  no   

SCSI  yes  ADB  yes  Floppies  yes     They can all cause trouble
