   Does anyone have a reference  something I can look up  not just your own
   recollections    I have a few of those myself  on the temperature of the
    night  sky as seen from space 
  
   Note  I am  not  talking about the temperature of the Microwave Background
   Radiation   There are more things in the sky than just the MBR  what I m
   after is total blackbody temperature    what a thermal radiator would see 
   disregarding  or shielding against  the Sun and nearby large warm objects 
 
 
I m not sure if this will help you  but the  local  interstellar
radiation field has been measured and modeled by various groups   If I
remember things correctly  the models involved contributions from three
different BB sources  so there s no obvious  temperature  of background
radiation in our local area   However  the following references give the
interstellar radiation density as a function of wavelength  and you can
integrate and average in an appropriate manner to get an  effective 
temperature if you like 

Witt and Johnson        Astrophys  J                
Henry et al         Astrophys  J                
Mathis et al         Astron  Astrophys                

As you can see  the references are out of date  but they might get you
started 

Hope this helps
