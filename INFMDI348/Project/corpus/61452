   	As Herny pointed out  you have to develop the thruster 
   Also  while much lighter  you still have to lift the mass of
   the thruster to orbit  and then the thruster lifts its own 
   weight into a higher orbit   And you take up room in the payload
  bay 
  
  
  a yes   but the improvement in  boost orbit to the HST is Significant 

I do not understand what you are saying here   What is improved  what 
is Significant  and what does this have to do with carrying more 
equipment on a servicing mission   Also  as implied by other posters  why 
do you need to boost the orbit on this mission anyway   Maybe you have 
something here  but could you please clarify it for us on the net  

  and  that means you can then carry EDO packs  and enough consumables
  so the SHuttle mission can go on long enough to also fix the
  array tilt motors   and god knows what else  is going to wear out

From what I ve heard  the motors are fine   it is one of the two 
sets of electronics that control the motors that needs a fix   The 
motors and electronics are separate pieces of hardware   I expect 
to be corrected if I m wrong on this  

  on the HST in the next   months
