MB Also  what about bio engineered CO  absorbing plants instead of many LOX bot
MB  

I wonder why the term  bio engineered  was added to the comment  As I
review the problems of Space Biosphere  in Arizona  and work on
modelling a new composting vermiculture system to propose for the next
generation of closed system environments  I believe that biological
carbon sinks are essential to help regulate CO   In my models  humus is
an optimum carbon repository that can help buffer increases in
atmpospheric CO   Why consider  bio engineering  some mythical plant
when the existing organisms are well suited to the task if managed
properly
