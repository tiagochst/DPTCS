Hi folks

I m planning to buy a LCIII but need advice on choosing a monitor 
What do people recommend for a decent         monitor   

I v looked at some ads and the spec for NEC  FG  FGe and the price is 
within my budget  but could LCIII be able to use the various resolutions 
available on  FG  specifically the     x    resolution   Does LCIII only 
support one resolution 

Also any recommendations for a reliable mail order place for LCIII or
monitors  Does anyone have experience with the following mail order places 

	SYEX EXPRESS 	 Houston  Tx 
	USA FLEX 	 Bloomingdale  Il 

Thanks 

jeff
