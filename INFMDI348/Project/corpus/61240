In article   r aqr dnv access digex net   prb access  Pat  writes 
 Voyager  has the unusual  luck to be on a stable trajectory out of the
 solar system    All it s doing is collecting  fields  data   and routinely
 squirting it down   One of the mariners is also in stable
 solar orbit   and still providing similiar  solar data   

There are no Mariner craft from which we are still receiving data   I believe
you are referring to one or more of Pioneers   through    launched from
December      through November        which were put into solar orbits to study
interplanetary space   I recall reading that at least one of them was still
functioning    years after launch
