  are you sure   g is the right number  as far as i know  pilots are
  blackout in dives that exceed  g    g    g seems to be out of human
  tolerance  would anybody clarify this please

  Apart from the fact that you get G in the pull out  not the dive  that
  figure is about right for sustained G  no protection 
  The duration of G  it s rate of onset  body position and support aids are
  all critical parts of the equation  I remember one note about instrumented
  gridiron players recording peaks about    G  Stapp  the aviation doctor 
  either by accident or design  took a short period   G in a rocket sled
  decelleration  eye balls out against a standard       s  harness  It had
  to be short  calculate the stopping time  even from          mph at that
  G  A bang seat can get up to about    G  and you d better be sitting
  straight  Find the book by Martin Bakers human guinea pig to hear how bad
  it can get if the rate of onset is too high  A reclining position and a
  good G suit can keep a pilot functioning at around   G 
  
  A flotation tank should be a good bet  since you can treat the body as a
  fluid  and high pressure situations are not new  Anyone have any figures

Yes a flotation tank  combined with floride breathing water REF  the Abyss
breathing solution I think    also the right position of the astronaut and
strapping you can probably get much more than   gs in an accesloration  
More like near    g  or somewhat less   

Saw I book called the  Time Master   I thjink that was the title  that had some
ideas on how fast and all you could go
