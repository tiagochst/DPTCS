     I just thought I d share a nice experience before my exam today 
I was walking down the streets on our campus  and a beggar came up and asked
me for any spare change I might have   I had a dollar or so that I gave her 
and   not wanting to give away all my money to strangers  I generally give
a dollar as that will buy a little food at McDonalds or something    I offered
her some  spiritual gifts   as I called them  rather than gifts of money 
I talked of how great I felt that God had made such a pretty day  and how
nice it was to give to people   she then said she was getting married soon 
She talked about how she and her husband had very little  they may not have
even had a house  for all I know   but that they felt a very special love in
the Lord  an unselfish kind of caring   It warmed my heart to know that  
people can have so little monetarily  and realize that spiritually they are
indeed very rich   A good lesson for all of us who say we want more  more 
more  what we really need cannot be counted  or sold  or bought
