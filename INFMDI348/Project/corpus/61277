  	If the  new  Kuiper belt object  is   called  Karla   the next
   one  should be called  Smiley  

 No  no  no   The previous one was called  Smiley         QB    Smiley 
 and      FW   Karla 

 By the way       QB  can never be known as  Smiley  officially  because
 that moniker has already been assigned to asteroid number      

Could someone explain where these names come from    I m sure there s a 
perfectly good reason to name a planetoid  Smiley   but I m equally sure that
I don t know what that reason is
