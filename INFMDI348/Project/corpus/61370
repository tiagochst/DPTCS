First  kjenks gothamcity jsc nasa gov  Hey  that s me   wrote 
    I have       MB worth   uuencode d GIF images contain charts outlining
    one of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered in
    Crystal City        

Second  kjenks gothamcity jsc nasa gov  me again  wrote 
  I just posted the GIF files out for anonymous FTP on server ics uci edu 
  You can retrieve them from

  The last two are scanned color photos  the others are scanned briefing
  charts 

  These will be deleted by the ics uci edu system manager in a few days 
  so now s the time to grab them if you re interested   Sorry it took
  me so long to get these out  but I was trying for the Ames server 
  but it s out of space 

But now I need to clarify the situation   The   incoming  directory on
ics uci edu does NOT allow you to do an  ls  command   The files are
there  I just checked on          at      CDT   and you can  get  them
 don t forget the  binary  mode    but you can t  ls  in the
  incoming  directory 

A further update  Mark s design made the cover of Space News this week
as one of the design alternatives which was rejected   But he s still
in there plugging   I wish him luck    using ET s as the basis of a
Space Station has been a good idea for a long time 

May the best design win
