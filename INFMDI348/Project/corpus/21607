 Hello all 
      I have a question about Satan   I was taught a long time ago
 that Satan was really an angel of God and was kicked out of heaven
 because he challenged God s authority   The problem is  I cannot
 find this in the Bible   Is it in the Bible   If not  where did it
 originate 
 Wondering 
 Eddie
 
Hi Eddie  many people believe the battle described in Rev        
describes the casting out of Satan from heaven and his fall to the
earth 
Shalom                              Len Howard
