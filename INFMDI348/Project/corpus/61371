Summary  Ron Miller book on history of spaceships from Krieger Publishing
Keywords  spaceships spacecraft astronautics history SF Miller

Ron Miller is a space artist with a long and distinguished career   
I ve admired both his paintings  remember the USPS Solar System
Exploration Stamps last year   and his writings on the history of
spaceflight   For several years he s been working on a  big  project
which is almost ready to hit the streets   A brochure from his
publisher has landed in my mailbox  and I thought it was cool enough
to type in part of it  it s rather long    Especially given the Net s
strong interest in vaporware spacecraft

This text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a
technological phenomenon   The idea of a vehicle for traversing the
space betwen worlds did not spring full blown into existence in the
tlatter half of theis century   The need preceded the ability ot make
such a device by several hundred years   As soon as it was realized
that there were other worlds than this one  human beings wanted to
reach them    

Tracing the history of the many imaginative  and often prescient 
attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of
technology  science  astronomy  and engineering   Once space travel
became feasible  there were many more spacecraft concepts developed
than ever got off the drawing board   or off the ground  for that
matter   These also are described in theis book  for the same reason
as the pre space age and pre flight ideas are   they are all accurate
reflections of their particular era s dreams  abilities  and
knowledge   Virtually every spaceship concept invented since       as
well as selected events important in developing the idea of
extraterrestrial travel  is listed chronologically   The chronological
entries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and
speculative ventures   They also allow comparisons between
simultaneous events taking place in different countries   They reveal
connections  influences  and evolutions hitherto unsuspected   Every
entry is accompanied by at least one illustration   Nearly every
spacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing   This
allows accurate comparisons to be made between designss  to visualize
differences  similarities  and influences 

This text will be of interest to students of astronautical history 
and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic
diagrams    Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and
historians of science will also find this book to be fascinating   The
unique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and
very interesting history of the spaceship
