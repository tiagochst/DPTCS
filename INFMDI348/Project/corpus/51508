In the MacUser article on the new centris and quadra machines mentioned
that the C    and the Q     and not the C     had ROM accelerated video 

It didn t seem to make much difference in their  benchmark  test 

What is it   I don t recall seeing it in Dale Adams post

P S   could someone tell me if Dale s posts on video and memory are
archived somewhere
