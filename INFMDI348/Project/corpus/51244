mccullou snake  cs wisc edu  Mark McCullough  writes 
  I think you mean circular  not recursive  but that is semantics 
  Recursiveness has no problems  it is just horribly inefficient  just ask
  any assembly programmer  

Tail recursive functions in Scheme are at least as efficient as iterative
loops   Anyone who doesn t program in assembler will have heard of optimizing
compilers
