 Mind you  this doesn t mean you shouldn t do it   The parts that can
 blow  the ADB power fuse and RF filter  aren t too expensive  so IF you
 have a someone around who can do component level repair  it may be worth
 the risk  especially if you re around Seattle   cause you might get to
 pay  me  to fix it         On the other hand  if your only repair option
 is the Apple standard logic board swap  major        you should probably
 play it safe 
 
 
 SCSI  yes  ADB  yes  Floppies  yes     They can all cause trouble 

OTOH  some of us get lucky   I ve unplugged and replugged SCSI and ADB
quite often  and never blown anything   I blew out the ADB by shorting
the cable  though
