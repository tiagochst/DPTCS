In article  May                        athos rutgers edu   you write 
   
    I fear orthodox theologians have been overly in love with paradox  to
   the extent that well meaning people think they ve just flat out
   confused   There s no problem with things being both   and    e g   if
   the   are different parts of the        
   But they re in some way
   different aspects  modes  or whatever  of one God   If you accept
   economic trinitarianism  it s possible that you don t have any
   substantive difference with the standard view   Is it possible that
   you just don t find the neo Platonic explanation illuminating 
     clh 

I would put it stronger than that   I consider it nonsense 

Simply put  I do not see any way that a  Platonic essence  could have
any  real  existance    Essence  in the Platonic sense does not have
any referent as far as I can tell   it is just an imaginary concept
invented to provide an explanation for things better explained in
other ways 

So  to attribute an  essence  to God is to attribute to him something that
does not exist    Thus the orthodox Platonic formulation seems to leave
the unity of God in limbo  since it is based on a non existant  essence  
thus failing to avoid the very problem it was supposed to address 

Thus  to me  the unity of God must be primary  and the triality must be
secondary  must be modal or aspectual  relating to roles  or to modes
of interaction   since otherwise there is no meaning to saying God is one

 I think one can read Augustine as saying something consistent with
your comments   His  De Trinitate     which has been very influential
in the West    defines the distinction among the persons relationally 
You re probably at one extreme of orthodox views  but I m not sure
your views are necessary incompatible with the Trinity     clh
