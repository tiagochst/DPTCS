  When the computer is set for     colors and certain operations are done 
  particularly vertical scrolling through a window  horizontal white lines
  appear on the monitor  which generally but not always spare open
  windows    These lines accummulate as the operation is continued   If a
  window is moved over the involved area of the screen and then moved away
  the line disappear from that area of the screen   This problem is not
  observed if the monitor is configured for    colors or a    inch Apple
  monitor with     colors is used  
  
  I suspect a bad video RAM chip but cannot be certain   The problem has
  been apparent since day   but has gotten worse 

I m having exactly the same problem   Again  it s fine when I switch to   
colors or a smaller monitor   My configuration is 

Model  Centris     with   MB    HD      VRAM  no cards
Monitor  MAG MX  F with     monitor adaptor  for resolution of         

I just discovered the problem a little while ago after plugging in my
new MAG monitor   It seems to appear either when scrolling through a
window or when using Alpha or Word and I enter  return  

My guess is bad VRAMs as well   I really hope it isn t a design flaw   Is
anyone at Apple listening
