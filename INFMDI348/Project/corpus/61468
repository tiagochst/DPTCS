In article  C  AGI MJu news cso uiuc edu  jbh      uxa cso uiuc edu  Josh Hopkins  writes 
 I m wondering if  vandalize  is the proper word to use in this situation   My
 dictionary defines  vandalism  as  the willful or malicious destructuion of 
 public or private property  especially of anything beautiful or artisitc   I
 would agree the sky is beautiful  but not that it is public or private property 

It s public because it belongs to everybody   It s vandalism because many people    power companies    do maliciously waste light   If they can sell you
or your city or your state an unshielded light that wastes    to    percent
of its light  they make more  money    Never mind that your money is wasted 
Never mind that taxpaper s money is wasted   Never mind that the sky is ruined
