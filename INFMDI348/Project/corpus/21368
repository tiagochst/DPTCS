 Arrogance is arrogance   It is not the result of religion  it is the result
 of people knowing or firmly believing in an idea and one s desire to show
 others of one s rightness   I assume that God decided to be judge for our
 sake as much as his own  if we allow him who is kind and merciful be the 
 judge  we ll probably be better off than if others judged us or we judged 
 ourselves                                                                
          
  Cor           But if we judged ourselves  we would not come under judgment  
When we are judged by the                  Lord  we are being discipled so
that we will not be condemned with the world  

  Cor      Even though I am not physically present  I am with you in spirit 
And I have already passed judgment on the one who did this  just as if I were
present                           

  Cor          The spiritual man makes judgments about all things  but he
himself is not               subject to any man s          judgement    For
who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him    But we have the
mind of Christ  

Jude         Enoch  the seventh from Adam  prophesied about these men    See 
the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones to judge
everyone  and to        convict all the ungodly of                         all
the ungodly acts they have done in the ungodly way  and of all the harsh words
ungodly sinners have spoken against him   

Arrogance is a sin   Although a desire to show others of one s rightness may
be a sign of arrogance in some cases   it may be only a sign that they are
following the Bible in others 

Jude         Be merciful to those who doubt  snatch others from the fire and
save them  to others show mercy  mixed with         fear    hating       even
     the clothing stained by corrupted flesh  


 If I find someone arrogant  I typically don t have anything to do with them   

I hope you don t find me arrogant  then   This sounds like a bad practice   
ignoring what certain people say because you perceive them as arrogant 

James       My dear brothers  take note of this   Everyone should be quick to
listen  slow to speak and slow to become angry  

  Aaron
