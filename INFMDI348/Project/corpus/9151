   With my limited knowladge about the PC Geos  I came out with following 
   comparison

   You guys and gals add to this list  so we do not throw our many down the 
   tubes 
   
                         With highest regards

This list appears to imply  that MS windows that has a cost listed
above at      comes with a C compiler  C   and Fortran  It does not  of
course  These are expensive add ons that drive the price WAY beyond     
  I don t know if the same applies to OS    

As far as unix is concerned 
There is a free unix  linux  that has cc   c    fortran   f c   
Xwindows and many other features besides  with a large number of utilities
that can be optionally added  And there is also a free    BSD I believe 
Both these unix s are quite robust  You can check out comp os linux

If you don t want to  throw our many down the tubes   you ve got to break
that list down a little more
