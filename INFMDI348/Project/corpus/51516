   I am working a  data acquisition and analysis program to collect data
   from insect sensory organs 
   Another alternative is the use of the sound input port 
 
 Can you really make due with the non existent dynamic range of an   bit
 converter  of probably dubious linearity and monotonicity  and perhaps
 AC coupled as well 

It would depend on the requirements of the poster s data  for some
purposes       resolution  with or without calibration curve  


Otherwise the other possibilities would be 

   get a digital voltameter with serial output   connect to serial
port on mac  collect data with some communications program 

   Buy an A D chip from Analog devices  Burr Brown  etc  connect to
a parallel to serial converter  use serial port for acquisition
 nah  too much soldering and trouble shooting    

   Get a board from National Instruments  Data Translation  Omega 
etal   The finest solution  but possibly the most costly 



To the original poster   if the signal is too large  why not
use a voltage divider  Two resistors  cost very cheap
