         But try to land a shuttle with that big huge telescope in the 
  back and you could have problems   The shuttle just isn t designed to land 
  with that much weight in the payload 

 Is HST really  that  much heavier than a Spacelab    

HST is about        lbs         kg    That doesn t include the cradle that
would have been in the cargo bay when it was deployed   Spacelab J on STS   
was        lbs  according to the press kit   

As someone else pointed out if they had been unable to deploy it for some
reason that would have had to land with it still in the cargo bay and this
was a planned for contingency   This is not a problem for the shuttle 
though it would eliminate KSC as a landing site  they still have to go to
Edwards when landing with something like Spacelab in the cargo bay
