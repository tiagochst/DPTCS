 Like i said   get a vote  and create some more national parks   which
 include onobstructed air space 

You should have heard Prof  McNally   from my days as an astronomy
undergraduate  denouncing photon pollution  It was easy to imagine him
taking practical steps to modify the sodium lamps on the street
outside Mill Hill observatory with a    gauge shotgun    

However  seriously  it is possible to limit the effects of
streetlights  by adding a reflector  so that the light only
illuminates the ground  which is after all where you need it  As a
bonus  the power consumption required for a given illumination level
is reduced  Strangely enough  astronomers often seek to lobby elected
local authorities to use such lighting systems  with considerable
success in the desert areas around the major US observatories  At
least  thats what McNally told us  all those years ago 
  British local authorities couldn t care less  as far as I can see  

I suppose that the  right  to dark skies is no more than an aspiration 
but it is a worthwhile one  Illuminated orbital billboards seem especially
yukky  and are presumably in the area of international law  if any  although
I do find the idea of a right to bear anti satellite weapons intriguing
