 With a little luck  I could own a C    sometime in the near future  and
 so I was just wondering if someone could clear these two questions up for me 
 
     What speed SIMMS does the C    need want    I know that it needs   ns
 VRAM   not sure for the main RAM  
 

  ns    pin simms 

     I ve heard two conflicting stories about the total expandibility of the
 C    s RAM       and     megs   Which is true    Perhaps another phrasing
 would be better   does the   meg version come with all   megs on the logic
 board  or   megs   a   meg SIMM  
 
  configs   mb    mb  In each case the memory is soldered on the board
leaving the   simm sockets open     mb is the total addressable memory for a
    

 Just wondering
