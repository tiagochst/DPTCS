 There are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter 
 One must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was
 written by their enemies   Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret
 information to Peter  James  and John after His resurrection  and that
 those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve
  Eusebius   Historia Ecclesiastica  II        

This is curious  I read in  EH    

 The Lord imparted the gift of knowledge to James the Just  to John 
and Peter after his resurrection  these delivered it to the rest of 
the apostles  and they to the seventy  of whom Barnabas was one  
			 
			    Eusebius   Ecclesiastical History 

It seems that the Lord imparted the gift of knowledge  not that the
Lord imparted secret information 

     

 apostles   Interestingly enough  Eusebius refers to the groups which
 we today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis  Eusebius 
 op  cit   III            His gripe was not that thay professed  a 
 gnosis  but that they had the  wrong  one 

I m afraid that I cannot find this portrayal in  EH   
I don t see anywhere in          where Eusebius mentions that certain 
gnostics had the wrong gnosis 

The closest is when Eusebius summarizes Hegesippus  statements  
    whilst if there were any at all  that attempted to pervert 
the sound doctrine of the saving gospel  they were yet skulking 
in dark retreats    

 Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways   I
 don t intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do  but I
 believe that evidence exists  favorably interpreted  of course  of
 early Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today 

 Favorably interpreted   Just in looking at two of the four 
references that you gave  I have the  EH  handy  Irenaeus and the 
 Clemetine Recognitions  I will have to look for  I see no room for 
such  interpretations  

And any such  interpretation  still falls short of an equivalence to 
the Temple Ceremonies  

The links for Jay s using  EH  for support are   imparting the gift 
of knowledge     imparted secret information     being given secret 
signs and tokens to gain entrance to heaven    But there is not
enough equivalence between the the ideas for us to be able to call 
this  favorable interpretation    It appears to be closer to 
 fabrication
