  You might want to re think your attitude about the Holocaust after
  reading Deuteronomy chapter    

On the contrary  after the Holocaust  I would be  very  cautious about my
interpretatoin of Deuteronomy      Not everything that happens is in
accordance with God s will    You might guess which side of the
predestination issue I am on    I will never  assume  that evil is 
punishment by God  especially when I am speaking of the evil that falls on
 someone else    For my own life  I will work to discern the hand of God
in the evil that befalls  me  

See the discussion earlier on Luke
