WYSIWYG design tools to create simple databases as well as to people who use 
Access Basic to create complex databases 

RATIONALE 
Eventhough Access is a new RDBMS  it is very popular because of its Graphical
Development enviroment and its initial low price 
Been a version     product means that all Access users are Novices 
For that reason a newsgroup is needed where Access users can discuss 
their experiences with the product and answer each other s questions
