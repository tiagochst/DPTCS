 addressing modes   commands that do fills should be slightly faster
 since the new instructions fetch   bytes at a time versus one 

Even the       can fetch two bytes at a time 

The new instruction in the       is MOVE   which fetches    bytes
at a time instead of   which the       has  that means     bit
pixels instead of one
