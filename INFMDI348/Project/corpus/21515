  In the NT  the clear references are all from Paul s letters   In Rom
     there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil 
  Note that the passage isn t about homosexuality    it s about
  idolatry   Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment  or at
  least result  of idolatry   There are a number of arguments over this
  passage   It does not use the word  homosexuality   and it is referring
  to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality 
  So it s not what I d call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality 

That s like saying that murder is only wrong for those of us who aren t natural
murders  and stealing is only wrong for those of us who aren t natural
thieves
