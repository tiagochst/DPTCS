        there is nothing in Christianity that precludes the idea of
     repeated lives on earth 

 Doesn t it say somewhere  It is appointed to man once to die 
 and then judgement   I don t have a concordance here but I have
 some dim memory that this appears  somewhere  in the Bible 
 Given a fairly specific context for what judgement is  I d say
 that more or less decides the issue 
  Heb        clh 

That depends on how this verse is read   There are at least two
meanings of the word  once       only one time  and    at some
other time  i e  once upon a time    Note that in the previous
verse  the word  once  is used with the second meaning  and also
in the following verse   once  is again used with the second meaning 
The Greek  I am sure  uses different words for each of the two meanings
for the English word  once    I am not a Greek scholar  but I m sure
someone here can verify which Greek word is used here for this meaning 
If the second meaning is being used  that verse can be interpreted as 

    for it was once given for men to die  beginning with Adam   but 
    after this  gift of atonement offered by Jesus Christ  the judgement
     is made available   for now there is no longer death  but life
    with Christ
