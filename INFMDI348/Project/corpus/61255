       humans  and this was published
   in       have already withstood accelerations of   g  All this is very
   long winded but here s my question finally   Are   g accelerations in
   fact humanly tolerable    with the aid of any mechanical devices of
   course 

lpham eis calstate edu  Lan Pham  writes 
 are you sure   g is the right number  as far as i know  pilots are
 blackout in dives that exceed  g    g    g seems to be out of human
 tolerance  would anybody clarify this please 

Actually  both numbers are correct   The difference is in the direction
of the acceleration   For pilots  accelerations tend to be transverse to
the direction you re facing  pulling out from a steep dive  the
acceleration will force blood toward your feet  for instance    In this
case  you can only put up with about   g s even with a pressure suit   

The record for acceleration  though  is measured along  the direction
you re facing   for lack of a better term    As I recall  this record
was set in rocket sleds back in the    s    and was about    g s or so
