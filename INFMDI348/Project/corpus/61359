  So  having seen Henry s encouraging statement about starting to talk
  about it  I shall 

  I feel that we as a community of people have unique resources
  to deliver to the world a comprehensive book which can elaborate
  on the utility of spaceflight to fields which are as divergent 
  as medical intensive care  agriculture  environmental protection  and 
  probably more   I do not believe that the general public understands

  	Teflon  So your eggs don t stick in the pan 
  	Pacemakers  Kept my grandfather alive from      until      


p s   To all the regular contributors to sci space news and
sci space shuttle  thanks for all your hard work keeping us informed
as to the doings down in NASA and other space type agencies   I don t
have much time to read USENET  but I ALWAYS read these two groups
