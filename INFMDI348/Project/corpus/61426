 The Forever War   one of my favorite SciFi books  had a passage devoted to 
breathing fluids  The idea was to protect people from the high accelerations 
required for interstellar travel by emersing the passengers in dry cleaning 
fluid saturated with oxygen  Plenty of very imaginative ideas is this book 
I would certainly recommend it  won the Hugo and the Nebula awards
