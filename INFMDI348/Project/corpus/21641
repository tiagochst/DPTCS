In article       athos rutgers edu  dhammers pacific    David Hammerslag  writes 

  This paragraph brought to mind a question   How do you  Mormons  reconcile
  the idea of eternal marriage with Christ s statement that in the ressurection
  people will neither marry nor be given in marriage  Luke  chapt      

That s the whole point  David   As spirits separated from their bodies
and living in the spirit world  they cannot undergo the ordinance of
marriage  just as they cannot be baptized  since there is no physical
body to be baptized   We perform these ordinances as proxies for them 
in their behalf   Thanks for asking   Brooks
