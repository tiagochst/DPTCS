 On the other hand  I lived in OakBrook IL for a while  where zoning
 laws prohibit billboards  as you mention above   I think it was a
 fine law  despite it s contradictory basis 

And I lived out there too   It was a nice sleepy farm valley until
the Butler family decided to stick up all sorts of really tacky
High RIse office buildings and ruin my view of the sky 

I guess i should have sued somebody
