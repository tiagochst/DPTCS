Ok I want to get a color Mac I don t care if it is an LC or a Mac II or

outright 
Here s what my Mac SE system has

ImageWriter II with   color ribbon

     with the system

MultiTech Multimodem II       data fax 
U S  Robotics Sportster       data 
Microcom QX   K          normally will connect at only      as highest
but it will do faster if connected to another Microcom
