Does anyone work with the A ROSE card 

We have the problem that after certain crashes the card disappears from the
system  and lets crash the Mac then 

Okay  we don t use the card quite like one should  because we simulate
errors in the        Before every instruction some specified registers are
masked  eg  to simulate a stuck at   error in certain bits 

Normally  the  crash instance  of A ROSE notices a crash  sets a flag and
stops working  By reading the mentioned flag the Mac can notice a card
crash  That works fine for almost all crashes  but as said  sometimes the
card doesn t set the flag and disappears from the system 

The documentation of A ROSE does not tell us anything about its behavior
when crashing  and so at the moment we are trying to understand by analyzing
the assembler code  and that s both frustrating and lengthy 

So  can anyone help 
Please only reply via email  as I don t read this group
