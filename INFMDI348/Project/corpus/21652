Hi Frank 

I ve read it a couple of times and I think that it is excellent 
Christiandom has needed this book for some time now  I suggest that
 every  Christian read it 

According to Hank  they printed    times more than Harvest House
usually prints for the first printing  and it still sold out in
the first week  It is in it s second printing  and most Christian
book stores have waiting lists  You can order it directly from CRI
at
