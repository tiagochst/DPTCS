   	I also believe that the     fixed a bug in the CPU which screwed up
   some floating point calculations

   Lubarsky s Law of Cybernetic Entomology   There s always one more bug 

  Does someone have any definite information on this   This is the
  first I ve heard of it   How does the CPU get fixed by a hardware
  upgrade   This doesn t make much sense to me 

 Let s see now    The differences between the     and     are
 basically 

 	   Runs at   MHz  not   MHz
 	   Has   MHz I O bus  not   MHz
 	   Upgraded Graphics controller
 	      results in Q    requiring   ns VRAM  not    ns
 	   ROM fixes 
 	    a  rounding errors in floating point calculations
 	       at   th digit

So patch the ROMs with the latest OS version   I don t see
how this is a problem 

 	    b  Ethernet problems with more than    buffers

 So  no doubt  the person was refering to  a  hardly  screwing
 up  though
