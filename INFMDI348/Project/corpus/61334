In article      Apr                midway uchicago edu   pef  midway uchicago edu writes   
 BATSE  by having   detectors of its own  can do its own location determination 
 but only to within about   degrees  would someone at GSFC  like David  like
 to comment on the current state of location determination     Having inde 
 pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty 
  

Well  I ll avoid your question for now  got some learnin  to do  with a
promise to come back with more info when I can find it   I  do  know that
BATSE is the primary instrument in the development of the all sky map of
long term sources   Given that fact  and the spacecraft attitude knowledge
of approx    arcmin  we might be able to figure out how well BATSE can
determine the location  rotational  of a Gamma Ray burster from knowledge
of the all sky map s accuracy   PR material for the other three instruments
give accuracies on the order of  fractions of a degree   if that s 
any help 

Speaking of GRO  the net world probably was happy to see that the preps
for orbit adjust appear to be going well   Our branch guy who s helping
out says that things have gone smoothly with the iso valve preps and the
burns will take place in mid June 

Anyway  I m off to find out more    Be back when I get some info
