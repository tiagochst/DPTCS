   I say 
   What I m objecting to here is a floating billboard that  presumably 
   would move around in the sky   I  for one  am against legislating
   at all   I just wish that people had a bit of common courtesy  and
   would consider how their greed for money impacts the more ethereal and
  aesthetic values that make us human   This includes the need for wild
  and unspoiled things  including the night sky 
  
  
  Sorry that s an aesthetics argument   maybe this string shoudl mofe to
  sci space aesthetics 
  
  Planes  ruin the night sky   Blimps ruin the night sky   Radio towers
  ruin the night sky   
  
  Like i said   get a vote  and create some more national parks   which
  include onobstructed air space 
  
  

Hokay   I am hereby voting my backyard to be a sanctuary   one acre 
where I can object to anything I do not like for aesthetic reasons  
       What a relief to know we both can be happy
