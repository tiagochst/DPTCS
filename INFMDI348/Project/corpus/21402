Peir Yuan Yeh asks 

 I wonder if the OT is not exactly like Jewish history   Are they the
same  or part of them are the same   How about Torah  Are the first five
books  of OT as the same as Torah     

Yes  yes  and yes   Jewish history as recorded in the Old Testament and
as shown by archaeology are the same   Kings  revivals  Temples  and all 

The Torah  as far as I know  is the five books of Moses   Then come the
Prophets  all the Prophets  plus Joshua  Judges      Samuel      Kings 
and the Writings  Psalms  Proverbs  Lamentations  Ruth  Esther  Ezra 
Nehemiah  Ecclesiates  Song of Songs      Chronicles  Job  

And the veracity of Isaiah  which you quoted to your Moslem friend is
quite well known   A complete manuscript exists that dates back to past
    BC  and is kept in a Museum in Israel   It was found among the Dead
Sea Scrolls  which greatly enhanced our knowledge of the veracity of the
Old Testament  as they date back to around the time of Christ  whereas
before  the oldest complete manuscript in Hebrew was from around     AD 

Your Moslem friend is sorely mistaken  but understandably so   If Jesus
was crucified  and atoned for our sins  he must have been God  for only
the death of God could atone for the sins of all humanity   And as
Isaiah predicts  the messiah will be called  the mighty God    And if he
was God  then he must have rose  for as St  Paul wrote  it was not
possible that death could hold him   And if Jesus rose from the dead 
your Moslem friend would have little reason to be a Moslem   Which is
why he denies the authenticity of the Old Testament
