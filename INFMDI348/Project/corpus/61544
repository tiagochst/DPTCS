      What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away 
  
    Given the enormous  power   i was just wondering   what if they are
    quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by 
  
    Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges 
  
       David gives good explaination of the deductions from the isotropic 
  edged  distribution  to whit  they are either part of the Universe or
 part of the Oort cloud 

I don t know what you mean by  edged   but surely there are two other
possibilities for an isotropic distribution  near interstellar  up to
     pc  i e  within the disc   or the Galaxy s corona 

 Why couldn t they be Earth centred  with the edge occuring at the edge
 of the gravisphere  I know there isn t any mechanism for them  but there
 isn t a mechanism for the others either

 Among the gods  there is a dispute as to which one of them originally
thought of Christianity  or  as they call it  the Great Leg Pull   Apollo
has the best claim  but a sizeable minority support Pluto  ex God of the
Dead  on the grounds that he has a really sick sense of humour    Tom Holt
