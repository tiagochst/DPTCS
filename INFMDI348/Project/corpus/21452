In article  May                       athos rutgers edu  db n  andrew cmu edu  D  Andrew Byler  writes 

  The so called Creed of Athanasius  however  has always been a Western
  creed  and has always had the filioque   The Orthodox have said that
  they accept all that it says  with the exception of the filioque  but
  it is not  in use  
   
 	Of course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene
 Creed  it wasn t there to begin with   but they certainly did from the
 Athanasian Creed  which did have it from the beginning 

The so called Athanasian Creed has never been a recognized standard of faith 
in the Orthodox Church  It was introduced  without the Filioque  in certain 
service books in the   th and   th centuries at a time when there was a 
strong Western influence on Orhtodoxy
