  I think you re talking about the  assumption of the Blessed Virgin
 Mary    It says that  The Immaculate Mother of God  the ever Virgin
 Mary  having completed the course of her earthly life  was assumed
 body and soul into heavenly glory    This was defined by a Papal
 statement in       though it had certainly been believed by some
 before that   Like the Immaculate Conception  this is primarily a
 Roman Catholic doctrine  and like it  it has no direct Biblical
 support   Note that Catholics do not believe in  sola scriptura  
 That is  they do not believe that the Bible is the only source of
 Christian knowledge   Thus the fact that a doctrine has little
 Biblical support is not necessarily significant to them   They believe
 that truth can be passed on through traditions of the Church  and also
 that it can be revealed to the Church   I m not interested in yet
 another Catholic Protestant argument  but if any Catholics can tell us
 the basis for these beliefs  I think it would be appropriate     clh 

That is generally accuate  but contains one serious error   We Catholics
do believe that God s revealed truth that is not explicitly recorded in
the Bible can be and is passed on through the Tradition of the Church 
It should be noted that the Tradition of the Church  otherwise known as
Sacred Tradition  is not the same as ordinary human traditions 
However  we do not believe that additional truth will be revealed to
the Church   Public revelation  which is the basis of Catholic doctrine 
ended with the death of St  John  the last Apostle   Nothing new can
be added   Theologians study this revelation and can draw out implications
that were not recognized previously  so that the Council of Nicea could
define statements about the theology of the Trinity and the Incarnation
that were not explicitly stated in the Bible and had been disputed
before the council  but there was no new revelation at Nicea or at
any subsequent council 

Cardinal Newman s  An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine  
written while he was still an Anglican  is an excellent discussion of
of this point   It was recently reprinted as a Doubleday Image Books
paperback with some related shorter works under the title  Conscience 
Consensus  and the Development of Doctrine

 What if there were no such thing as a hypothetical situation
