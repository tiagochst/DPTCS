 It s interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost control
 available in industry today were derived from Government projects 
 GANTT charts  CP M  and most of the modern scheduling software comes
 from DoD projects and their contractors   The construction industry


Of course 

	How many government projects after Using PERT  GANT  C P M s
Process flow diagrams   Level   software projects      actually
come in on schedule and under Cost   I know the GAO determined
that     of all NASA projects  miss their budgets due to failing
to adequately measure  engineering developement costs    

Me  I am allin favor of Government R D   I thought Bell Labs was one of the best 
to do research    I don t think the government should pour money
into any one sector   but should engage in projects which naturally
push the state of the art   

THings like  High tech  construction projects   apollo  was worth it for the doing   Running hte national labs   The SSC is grossly overweight   but
is a reasonable project at a lower cost   

Unfortunately support for solo investigators is direly neglected 

Maybe what they should do  is throw out much of the process and just tell
new PH ds   you get a   time grant of              If you produce  you
can  qualify for other grants   If you don t  you never get in again 

THis way  young people get a shot at  reserach   and older  stale 
scientists don t dominate the process
