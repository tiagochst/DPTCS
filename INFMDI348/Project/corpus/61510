 Mr  Hathaway s post is right on the money  if a little lengthy   In short 
 an orbiting billboard would be trash  in the same way that a billboard on
 the Earth is trash   Billboards make a place look trashy   That is why there
 are laws in many places prohibiting their use   The light pollution
 complaints are mainly an attempt to find some tangible reason to be against
 orbiting billboards because people don t feel morally justified to complain
 on the grounds that these things would defile the beauty of the sky 

I don t buy it   If the things had no value at all  people wouldn t
spend money to make them  So their lack of value is just your
opinion  not an actual fact  which is neither a philisophical or
legal basis for prohibiting them 

On the other hand  I lived in OakBrook IL for a while  where zoning
laws prohibit billboards  as you mention above   I think it was a
fine law  despite it s contradictory basis 

I would guess that the best legal and moral basis for protest would
be violation of private property    I bought this house  out in
the boondocks  specifically to enjoy my hobby  amateur astronomy   Now
this billboard has made that investment worthless  so I want the
price of the property  in damages    It wouldn t take too many
succesful cases like that to make bill sats prohibitively expensive
