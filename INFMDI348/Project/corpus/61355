  I would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for Humans 
  I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere evolve given a range
  of physical aspects of the planet   The question is what physical aspects
  simply disallow earth like conditions

     Dandridge Cole and Isaac Asimov collaborated on a book titled 
   Habitable Planets for Man   I think  in        It should be available
  in most good libraries  or through inter library loan 
  

This is the high school science version  the original Rand study by
Stephen H Dole  Planets for Man  gives the harder numbers   graphs  
such  but predates Michael Hart s    later  work on continuously 
habitable zones
