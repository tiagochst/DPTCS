  I see no other way of interpreting them other than homosexuyality
  being wrong   Please tell me how these verses can be interpreted in
  any other way   I read them and the surrounding text 

But that is exactly what I was asking  If the Homosexual community  is that
the proper term   has decided that Christianity is not against Homosexual 
behaviour but rather condones it then how do they interpret these verses  I
guess what I am really looking for is a  homosexual  response
