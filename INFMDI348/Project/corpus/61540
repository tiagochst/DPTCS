  No  the thing is designed to be retrievable  in a pinch   Indeed  this
  dictated a rather odd design for the solar arrays  since they had to be
  retractable as well as extendable  and may thus have indirectly contributed
  to the array flapping problems 
  
  
 Why not design the solar arrays to be detachable   if the shuttle is going
 to retunr the HST   what bother are some arrays   just fit them with a quick release 
  
I didn t think the bi stem design was used so much for the retrieval as
for the ability to launch in a tight  size  STS envelope   This is my own 
guess  based on similar designs flown on other large STS launched s c 
 GRO  UARS    Also  there  might  be some consideration given to mass 
requirements  bi stems weight less than conventional S A    Finally  
the HST arrays  do  have the ability to be detached  remember  they re 
going to be replaced with new arrays 

However  as an ACS guy who s seen his branch management pull their
collective hair out over HST  I would voice a hearty  yea  to using
conventional arrays over bi stems  whenever possible   No half hertz
flexible modes  no thermal snap  no problem
