Eugen Bigelow writes 

 It is also noteworthy to consider Jesus  attitude  He had no
 argument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon  John
           and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus 
 that in the law  prophets and psalms which referred to him   the 
 OT division of Scripture  Luke         as well as in Luke      
 taking Genesis to Chronicles  the jewish order   we would say
 Genesis to Malachi  as Scripture 

You should remember that in Adam s transgression  all men and women
sinned  as Paul wrote   All of humanity cooperativley reblled against
God in Adma s sin  thus  all are subject to it  and the sin is
transmitted from generation to generation
