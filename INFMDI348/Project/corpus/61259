      What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away 
 
 Their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution 
 crudely speaking  indicates we re seeing an edge to the distribution 

How can you tell the difference between an intensity distribution which
is due to an  edge  in the spatial distribution and an intensity
distribution which is due an a sharp dropoff of intrinsic luminosities
below a certain threshold   Could you describe  roughly  what the
intensity distribution is like
