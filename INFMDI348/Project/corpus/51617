 About hard drive companies  the original     meg drive that was bad  bad
 sector or something  was an IBM   The new one is a Quantum   Is the LCIII
 supposed to be shipped with IBMs   Is there a quality difference  

Officially  no  From experience  yours now included    yes  Quantums seem to
be the most problem free brand on the Mac 

 Second  about hard drive position   I ve put the LCIII on its side and
 the new     HD has had no problems at all   I ve even switched back and
 forth between horizontal and vertical and there are no problems   As far
 as I m concerned I don t believe HD position is important for drives up
 to     meg  in any computer   Don t know about CD ROM  though 

It should not matter for the hard drive or the Mac   Well  as long as it
doesn t fall over
