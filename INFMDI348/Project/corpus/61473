  Option C   Single Core Launch Station 
  This is the JSC lead option  Basically  you take a    ft diameter
  cylinder that s    ft long  slap   Space Shuttle Main Engines on
  the backside  put a nose cone on the top  attached it to a 
  regular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket
  motors  and launch the can  Some key features are 
      Complete end to end ground integration and checkout
        tangentially mounted fixed solar panels
      body mounted radiators  which adds protection against
      micrometeroid   orbital debris 
        centerline docking ports  one on each end 
        berthing ports
      a single pressurized volume  approximately        cubic feet
       twice the volume of skylab  
        floors  center passageway between floors
         kW of housekeeping power
 
 Somehow I have a strange attraction for this idea  living in
 a modular home maybe has altered my mind    The only thing
 that scares me is the part about simply strapping   SSME s and
 a nosecone on it and  just launching it    I have this vision
 of something going terribly wrong with the launch resulting in the
 complete loss of the new modular space station  not just a peice of
 it as would be the case with staged in orbit construction  

I certainly like this  Option C      It s much more like the original
Phase B studies from the early      s   Good stuff
