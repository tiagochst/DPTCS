       For all the problems technology has caused  your types have made
  things even worse   Must we be reminded of the Inquisition  Operation
  Rescue  the Ku Klux Klan  Posse Comitatus  the     Club  David Duke  Salem
  Witch Trials  the Crusades  gay bashings  etc 
       PLUS virtually each and every single war  regardless of the level of
  technology  has had theistic organizations cheering on the carnage
   chaplains  etc    and claiming that god was in favor of the whole ordeal  
  Don t forget to pray for our troops 
       

This is really tedious  Every bad thing that s ever happened is
because the malefactors were under the influence of religion   does
anyone  really  believe that  I ve seen it so often it must be a
pretty general opinion in a a  but I want to believe that atheists are
really not THAT dishonest  Please  stick to the facts and  having
accomplished that  interpret them correctly 

Bill
