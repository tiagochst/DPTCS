 The material was useful for seals  but it had a major problem for  say
 the linings of vessels  it wouldn t stick to metal   What the space
 program did was to find a way to get it to stick   Thus we had no stick
 frypans on the market in the late    s 


Ejon Matejevic who was a full professor at Clarkson University  last
I heard   developed the process for sticking Teflon to metals 

I don t think it was a NASA project  cuz i heard he held the patent
on it  and had made quite a bundle off it 

Anyone from Clarkson know the Exact story   I never wanted to ask
him myself
