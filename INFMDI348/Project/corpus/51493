    the last time I looked  floptical disk
 weren t all that cheap       per floptical disk         per megabyte     
 per sysquest is       per megabyte  

Flopticals have been available since the beginning of the year at    
per floptical          per megabyte   and I have seen them advertised
in MacWEEK at              per megabyte    For someone on a tight
budget  the fact that the minimal dollar increment for more storage is
less       versus       sometimes matters
