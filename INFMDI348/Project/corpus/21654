 	    It is more likely than not that when St  John  or whomever  wrote
 		the book of Revelation WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED SCRIPTURE was
 		   NOT    the same thing you and I are holding in our hands 

 		Revelation was almost certainly written durin the reign of 
 	Domition  sp    A D          Thus it could be argues that we are all
 	in sin if we accept   Peter as scripture  since it was  added  to the
 	book after the composition of Revelation  when we are told to add 
 	nothing more 

	Okay  I went back and looked   sure enough  my hunch was right 
	
		  Peter was most likely written between         A D 
		
		Revelation was almost certainly written between       A D 
		
		Odds are the gospel of John was written around    A D 
		
		Best dates for Luke and Acts are around    A D   maybe later 
		
	Again  this is from footnoted information in the New American Bible 
	the best translation I ve come across in regards to giving complete
	historical information about each book

 Of course the folks who you re arguing with almost certainly do
not accept   Peter as being pseudonymous   In that case they d
have to date it far earlier than this     clh
