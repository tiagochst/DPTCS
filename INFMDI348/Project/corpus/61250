Alan Carter writes 

       On April     a NO OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to
       hours  its planned value during this mission phase 

  This activity is regularly reported in Ron s interesting posts  Could
  someone explain what the Command Loss Timer is 

The name is rather descriptive   It s a command to the spacecraft that tells
it  If you don t hear from Earth after     hours  assume something is wrong
with your  the spacecraft  attitude  and go into a preprogrammed search mode
in an attempt to reacquire the signal from Earth  

The spacecraft and Earth are not in constant communication with each other 
Earth monitors the telemetry from the spacecraft  and if everything is fine 
there s no reason to send it any new information   But from the spacecraft s
point of view  no information from Earth could mean either everything is
fine  or that the spacecraft has lost signal acquisition   Just how long
should the spacecraft wait before it decides that something is wrong and
begins to take corrective action   That  how long  is the command loss timer 
During relatively inactive cruise phases  the command loss timer can be set
to rather long values   In this case  Earth is telling Galileo  expect to
hear back from us sometime within the next     hours
