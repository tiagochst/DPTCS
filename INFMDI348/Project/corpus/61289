 I would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for Humans 
 I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere evolve given a range
 of physical aspects of the planet   The question is what physical aspects
 simply disallow earth like conditions 
 
 eg Temperature range of    K to    K  where temp is purely dependant on dist
      from the sun and the suns temperature   
    Atmospheric presure     I know nothing of human tolerance
    Planetary Mass     again gravity at surface is important  how much
      can human bodies take day after day   Also how does the mass effect
      atmosphere   I thinking of planets between    and   times mass of the
      earth   I suppose density should be important as well 
 
 Climate etc does not concern me  nor does axial tilt etc etc   Just the above
 three factors and how they relate to one another 
 
   Dandridge Cole and Isaac Asimov collaborated on a book titled 
 Habitable Planets for Man   I think  in        It should be available
in most good libraries  or through inter library loan 

   It answered the questions you ask  speculatively  of course   along
with many more that need to be considered in habitability studies 
length of day  for day night temperature variation  and agricultural
concerns   partial pressures of certain unexpected gasses  ever hear of
xenon narcosis   neither did I   density of particulates in the atm  and
their composition  ever hear of silicosis   not much fun   etc 

   Climate isn t a global phenomenon and probably needn t concern you 
but axial tilt ought to   It plays a large part in determining the
severity of seasonal differences  and a lesser but still significant
part in determining the speed of prevailing winds
