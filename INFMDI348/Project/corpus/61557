 My data shows that the OMS engines hold        kg of propellant   Of that  a 
 substantial fraction is going to be used for the first OMS burn  the reentry
 burn and the reserve   So Pat  tell us how much fuel the altitude change is
 going to take  and how much the EDO pallet  BUS   and extra parts are going
 mass   If you can make the numbers work out   then  I ll be interested   After
 you show us that it can be done  then tell us how much the EDO pallet  BUS  
 and extra equipment is going to cost   
 

I don t know   Does anyone in NASA land know how much fuel is
budgeted for the altitude change 

Henry   any figures on the mass   full   for the EDO pallet  plus
it s dry weight   How about for the dry mass of Bus     it was
being de classified as i checked last 

Also  I need 

    current orbital parameters of HST 

    projected  orbital parameters after re boost 

    Discovery s  DRY weight

   HST s Dry weight 


  I somehow think they could train up a new  EVA in    months 
 
 First  while astronauts certainly have done EVAs with minimal planning  that was
 because they  had  to   They don t like to do that as a general rule 
 

So how long do they need to train   a year     years   somehow
I think     moths should be adequate 

 Second  remember why they had to improvise during Intelsat     They were trying
 to attach a motor to a piece of hardware that wasn t designed to do that   
 Trying to shortcut the training is only going to make a repeat more likely 
 

Also because they significantly lacked on orbit EVA experience   
The HST is designed for on orbit servicing   it should be a lot easier 

 Third  they don t have eight months   They have however much time is left 
 after someone comes up with a plan  shows it can work and gets it approved 
 You may think I have a pessimistic attitude   I think it s realistic   I m not
 saying that the engineering task is impossible  few engineering tasks are    
 What I m saying is that this is neither cost effective nor feasible under NASA
 management 
 

There comes a time in every project  to kill the management 

They can if neccessary  re schedule the  HST mission   December is
not a drop dead date  unlike say the LDEF retrieval mission   


 
  All they have to do is soup it up    Just what does that mean   
 

I suspect  the BUS    may not have enough basic thrust for the HST
re boost   it mayu need bigger tanks   or bigger thrusters 


My understanding is the Second HST servicing mission is not
a contingency   My understanding is the mission  needs both
a new FOC  and work on the electrical system   plus
another re boost    

 
  If the SMT can avoid a second servicing mission that s      million
  saved 
 
 No Pat   That s      million minus the cost of the new hardware  minus the cost
 of the extra struff you want to bring along  minus development and mangement 
 costs  minus extra operating costs   TANSTAAFL 
 

Somehow  i think the cost of an expendable SMT will be less then
     million 

and the extra stuff is real cheap   NASA has lots of suits   MMU s 
and the EDO pallets are re usable   Oh  one double magnum of champagne 
now there s a couple hundred bucks 

 


 
 Pat  not only is this messy and less reliable than a device that s  made  to 
 perform this task  it also ignores the point   There is a desire to have 
 astronauts available so that if the door fails to open  something can be done
 about it   Unless you can provide a very reliable way of reopening the door 
 you haven t solved the problem 


That door has cycled  X times already   Once after massive G loading 
I somehow think they can work ou reliability  methods to ensure the
door works 

Also   please tell me how some sort of sublimated  material  like
CO   or H O  would manage to contaminate the mirror   anything
that goes to vapor state  shouldn t adhere to the mirror 

somehow  the door   problem can be worked   maybe they can put a one
time spring on it 

what do they do now  if the door hangs up   that door is part
of a intrument safing mechanism   if it hangs up tomorrow   it ll
be   months until someone gets up there witha crowbar to fix it
