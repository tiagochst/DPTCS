     ATTENTION  Mac Quadra owners  Many storage industry experts have
     concluded that Mac Quadras suffer from timing irregularities deviating
     from the standard SCSI specification  This results in silent corruption
     of data when used with some devices  including ultra modern devices 
     Although I will not name the devices  since it is not their fault   

 That s fine  but would you name the  industy experts  so I can try to track
 this down 

Who knows    I just quoted what was  written  in SCSI Director   

   This doesn t sound right to me   Don t Quadras use the   C     If so  the
   Mac has nothing to do with the SCSI timing   That s all handled by the
   chip 

 Yup   That s why I m kinda curious    most SCSI problems I ve encountered
 are due to cabling 

I ve tried calling Transoft Corp about this and have either gotten the
response  Huh   to  Yep  to  Nah     You would expect that a damaging state 
ment like this would have  some   data  to back it up   

Anyone want Transoft s phone number
