    Option C   Single Core Launch Station 
    This is the JSC lead option  Basically  you take a    ft diameter
    cylinder that s    ft long  slap   Space Shuttle Main Engines on
    the backside  put a nose cone on the top  attached it to a 
    regular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket
    motors  and launch the can  Some key features are 
        Complete end to end ground integration and checkout
          tangentially mounted fixed solar panels
        body mounted radiators  which adds protection against
        micrometeroid   orbital debris 
          centerline docking ports  one on each end 
          berthing ports
        a single pressurized volume  approximately        cubic feet
         twice the volume of skylab  
          floors  center passageway between floors
           kW of housekeeping power
   
   Somehow I have a strange attraction for this idea  living in
   a modular home maybe has altered my mind    The only thing
   that scares me is the part about simply strapping   SSME s and
   a nosecone on it and  just launching it    I have this vision
   of something going terribly wrong with the launch resulting in the
   complete loss of the new modular space station  not just a peice of
   it as would be the case with staged in orbit construction  
  
  I certainly like this  Option C      It s much more like the original
  Phase B studies from the early      s   Good stuff 

This is actually more like the stuff from Phase A and MOL    Phase B ended
with a  Power Tower  approach    

It s also VERY expensive in terms of upfront development costs    so all
you get is a redistribution of costs from the shuttle flights to the
contractors who build it
