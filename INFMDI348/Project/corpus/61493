                       MARS OBSERVER STATUS REPORT
                             April         
                                    AM PDT

DSS     Madrid    meter antenna  did not acquire the expected Mars Observer
Spacecraft signal at the scheduled beginning of track yesterday morning       
at approximately      AM   Indications were that the spacecraft had entered a
Fault Protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normal
telemetry at the end of the previous station pass  DSS      Goldstone   
meter antenna  at approximately      PM the evening before   Entry into
Contingency Mode was verified when signal was reacquired and telemetry
indicated that the spacecraft was sun coning   After subsystem engineers
reported all systems performing nominally  fault protection telemetry modes
were reconfigured and memory readouts of command system Audit Queue and
AACS  Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem  Starex performed   These
readouts verified that Contingency Mode entry occurred shortly after      AM
yesterday            Preliminary indications are that a Sun Ephemeris Check
failure triggered fault protection   However  the Flight Team will be
determining the precise cause over the next few days 

As of last evening  the spacecraft had been commanded back to Inertial
Reference and was stable in that mode   The Flight Team is planning to
command the spacecraft back to Array Normal Spin state today 

Magnetometer Calibration activities had completed prior to Contingency
Mode entry   MAG Calibration data has been recorded on Digital Tape
Recorders   and     Playback of DTRs   and    scheduled to be completed
yesterday  was postponed when Contingency Mode entry halted Flight
Sequence C  execution   The Flight Team is developing a strategy to restart
C  to complete data playback   Present planning is to perform playbacks
between  as soon as Wednesday  or as late as Friday of next week      
      dependent on Contingency Mode recovery activity   DTR playback will
be performed via the High Gain Antenna at        bits per second   Upon
verification of successful DTR playbacks  downlink will be maintained at
the  K S   E rate
