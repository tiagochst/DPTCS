 The only problem I have with what you tell  is the usual problem I have
 with Honor  tm   your family seems to have confused honor  pride  and
 stupidity   I  would feel that  when  shown  I was wrong   my  honor
 would  demand  that I apologize   etc      

Ahhhhh  but that  is  the point    Honor should demand that each of them
recognize that there is error fault misunderstanding aplenty in the
situation  and to apologize to each other 

But  since there is no honor  between  the two of them  they hold to
their own thickheaded paths  refusing to recognize each other as human 
and dragging the family feud out into the future 

Honor is both an individual trait  and a contract  between  two or more
folk
