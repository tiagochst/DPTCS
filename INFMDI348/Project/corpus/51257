                                        If I recall correctly there
 are protist cells that can divide and multiply quite readily without
 nuclear DNA   If memory serves me correctly this is the case with white
 cells in the blood    I rely on some indignant biologist to set me
 straight  

As someone who works with protists  this does not strike me as being true 
Are you confusing this with 

   Ciliates which have a macronucleus and a micronucleus  each containing
DNA  but in different amounts   The micronucleus is involved in mitosis 
and meiosis  the macronucleus seems to be the main  control center  of
the cell  or

   Two groups of unrelated protists  euglenoids and dinoflagellates  which
seem to have permanently condensed chromosomes   How these groups read
their DNA is quite a puzzle  as most models of how genes work involve 
the chromosomes being unwound
