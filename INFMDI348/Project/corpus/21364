  Dan s question about Mormon Temple rituals deleted for brevity 
   
  Just thought I would interject this  and I believe you Dan when you say
  that you don t mean to offend   For us LDS temple goers  the temple
  ceremonies are very sacred   So much so that anyone who goes there
  promises never to divulge them   So how much can you trust someone
  who is telling you about the cerermony  

 One thing I don t understand is why being sacred should make the
 temple rituals secret   There are lots of sacred things in
 Christianity  including the Sacred Scriptures themselves  but there is
 nothing secret about these things   

Is it appropriate for the Lord not to reveal certain 
things before the world  i e   publish them widely  

These things sacred to Himself   He may place any 
pre  or post conditions He feels are necessary 

Moreover  there are precedents in scripture where
knowledge of sacred things is withheld 

   After the Transfiguration Jesus instructed
Peter  James  and John to  tell the vision to no 
man  until the Son of man be risen again from 
the dead   Matt          
If we were living at the time of Savior  there
would be no  public  record of this event 

   A faithful friend of Paul experiences a vision 
of  paradise  when he  heard unspeakable words  
which it is not lawful for a man to utter 
   Cor        
This person heard something which Paul can not 
write to the Corinthians  and us  

   There is an incident recorded in the Book of
Mormon where words uttered by  babes  were 
 forbidden that there should not any man write
them    Nephi        the entire text follows
for those of you without access to the BOM  

  Nephi      
Behold  it came to pass on the morrow that the 
multitude gathered themselves together  and they
both saw and heard these children  yea  even 
babes did open their mouths and utter marvelous
things  and the things which they did utter were
forbidden that there should not any man write them 

Some LDS scholars speculate that these words
which could not be written are the sacred
portions from temple we are to withhold from 
the world  but it could be something else  

 I
 can understand why Mormons would limit temple access to only faithful
 Mormons  but I have never understood the emphasis on shrouding temple
 ritual in mystery   

There is much we can discuss about the temple 
ordinances   We can discuss regarding baptisms
and other vicarious ordinances for the dead 
We can discuss certain concepts regarding the
endowment   the ritual   
However  there are certain elements I can not
discuss with anyone  including other saints 
outside of the temple 
As a portion of the endowment  we receive the
tokens and signs that will permit us access
to Heaven   I must keep this knowledge sacred 
and respect the conditions under which it is
revealed to me
