In article  May                       athos rutgers edu   autry magellan stlouis sgi com  Larry Autry  writes 
       the subject of what the definition of
   Christianity is   His definition is tied directly to that of the
   Trinity and the Catholic church s definition of it and belief in
   Jesus Christ is not sufficient to call one s self a Christian 
      
   So  is there common definition of what Christianity is 

The basic definition that I use is 
	The belief that Jesus was God incarnate 
	The belief that Jesus was crucified and raised from the dead
	for our salvation 
	The acceptance of Jesus as personal Lord and Savior 

This would include most Christian denominations  but exclude the Unitarians
