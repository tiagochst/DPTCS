There s this old SE here  It s got the older style fans that remind
me of a house ventilator  A cylindrical drum instead of the bladed rotor
I usually see  Anyway  the SE makes this loud buzzing noise due
to vibration somewheres  If I remove the screws and loosen the front
from the back  it quiets down  I can only assume that the fan housing
from this goofy thing is touching the back of the case and vibrating
against it  

Anyway  any suggestions for where to get replacement fans and how to
 stealth  this guy  Your experiences welcome     

   
 If everything had gone as planned  everything would have been perfect
