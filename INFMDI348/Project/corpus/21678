This might be better directed to s r c bible study  which I have begun
reading  but since my earlier notes were posted to this forum  I will
conclude here as well   A week ago  I managed to find time to consult
a Septuagint Concordance and a LXX text with apparatus at the library 
and I can now usefully conclude my look at the Greek words for love as
used in the Christian background of the Septuagintal translation of the
Jewish scriptures 

The principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal
noun from  erao     eraste s  meaning  lover    This cluster occurs just
where one might most expect it  in the propethic image  and accusation 
of Israel as faithless spouse to YHWH   The verses in question are Hosea
            Jeremiah                   Lamentations       and Ezekiel
              and              

	  Hosea seems to have originated this usage  which Jeremiah and
	  Ezekiel picked up   Lamentations is dependent on  though not
	  likely written by  Jeremiah   

The  erotic  meaning  in its allegorical use  not at all literally  is
evident   So too in English  unless you complement it with a phrase like
 of the arts  the word  lover  is going to have an overtone of sexual
relationship   There is no surprise here  but it is worthwhile to see
that standard Greek usage  does  show up in the translations from the
Hebrew     

More interestingly  and some confirmation of my guess that later Koine
usage avoided the verb  erao   because of its homonymy to  ero    say  
 eromai   ask   there is an error in Codex Vaticanus  normally  a very
valuable witness  where a form of  erao   is used in a completely absurd
context      Samuel        where the  meaning  must  be  say  

In addition to the above  and the uses I have already mentioned in Proverbs  
Esther      uses the verb in its most natural application  

	kai e rasthe  ho basileus Esthe r      and the King loved Esther

and  rather more interestingly    Samuel      supplies a modest degree of
support to the gay appraisal of the relationship of David and Jonathan 

	kai Io nathan huios Saoul e  i reito ton Dauid sphodra
	   and Jonathan  Saul s son  loved David intensely

	  I m using the bracketed  i  for io ta subscript  which I
	  don t yet have a reasonable ASCII convention for   

 The relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about
the  historical  facts  but just that a quasi official translation of
the Hebrew text in the Hellenistic period makes no bones about using the
 erotic  verb in this context   Given the quite general usage of  agapao  
for erotic senses  this need not mean anything  more  than  agapao   alone
would mean  but it DOES disambiguate the relationship  as far as this
translator goes
