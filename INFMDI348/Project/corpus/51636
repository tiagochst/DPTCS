I m sure Intel and Motorola are competing neck and neck for 
crunch power  but for a given clock speed  how do we rank the
following  from  st to  th  
     		     
     		     
     		     

While you re at it  where will the following fit into the list 
       
  Pentium
  PowerPC

And about clock speed   Does doubling the clock speed double the
overall processor speed   And fill in the    s below 
             MHz              MHz

Thanks very much   I d appreciate hearing any further explanations
from any experienced folks out there  too
