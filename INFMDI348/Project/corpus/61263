James Nicoll writes 

 	If the  new  Kuiper belt object  is   called  Karla   the next
  one  should be called  Smiley  

No  no  no   The previous one was called  Smiley         QB    Smiley 
and      FW   Karla 

Note that neither name is official   It seems the discoverers have an
aversion to the designation scheme 

By the way       QB  can never be known as  Smiley  officially  because
that moniker has already been assigned to asteroid number
