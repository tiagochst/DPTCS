  In article  May                       athos rutgers edu     Anyone who thinks  
being gay and Christianity are not compatible should 
  check out Dignity  Integrity  More Light Presbyterian churches  Affirmation 
  MCC churches  etc   Meet some gay Christians  find out who they are  pray
  with them  discuss scripture with them  and only  then  form your opinion 
     

I would absolutly love to have the time and energy to do so  The
problem is to be totally fair I would have to go throught this type of
search on every issue I belive in   I don t have the time  resources 
or ability to do what you ask   Maybe you should pray that God gives
me the opportunity instead of simply discrediting me because I have
not been able to talk to every gay christian 

In Christ s Love 
Bryan
