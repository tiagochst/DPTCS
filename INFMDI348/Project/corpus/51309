  Mr Connor s assertion that  more complex     later in paleontology
  is simply incorrect   Many lineages are known in which whole
  structures are lost    for example  snakes have lost their legs 
  Cave fish have lost their eyes   Some species have almost completely
  lost their males   Kiwis are descended from birds with functional
  wings

The statements I made were illustrative of the inescapably
anthrpomorphic quality of any desciption of an evolutionary process 
There is no way evolution can be described or explained in terms other
than teleological  that is my whole point  Even those who have reason
to believe they understand evolution  biologists for instance  tend to
personify nature and I can t help but wonder if it s because of the
limits of the language or the nature of nature
