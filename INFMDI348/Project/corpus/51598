  ATTENTION  Mac Quadra owners  Many storage industry experts have
  concluded that Mac Quadras suffer from timing irregularities deviating
  from the standard SCSI specification  This results in silent corruption
  of data when used with some devices  including ultra modern devices 
  Although I will not name the devices  since it is not their fault  an
  example would be a Sony     inch MO  without the special  Mac compatible 
  firmware installed  One solution  sometimes  is to disable  blind writes 

This doesn t sound right to me   Don t Quadras use the   C     If so  the
Mac has nothing to do with the SCSI timing   That s all handled by the
chip   About the only the timing could be wrong is if Apple programs the
clock registers wrong on the      That  however  should only really hurt
synchronous transfer  which is not used by the Mac SCSI Manager 

Furthermore  disabling blind writes should be meaningless on a Quadra 
On Macs that used the       which is a much lower level SCSI chip  the
Mac was responsible for the handshake of each byte transferred   Blind
mode affected how the Mac handled that handshake   On the       the
handshake is entirely handled by the chip
