   I just got a Duo      and I m having some difficulties 
 If the machine is plugged in to the wall adapter  put to sleep 
 unplugged from the wall  and woken up  it crashes     of the time 
  There s nothing but the original system software on the machine  

 The battery has plenty of life   I think this must be a power manager
 problem  but I don t know what to do about it 

 Also  the speaker occasionally makes a high pitched hiss   The noise
 is irregular  but seems to favor sleep and restart commands 

I ve had my Duo     for a few weeks now and suffer from both
of the above problems  I reinstalled my system software twice
in an effort to combat the problems   thinking they were
system software problems  Initially reinstalling the system
seemed to help but not anymore  Occasionally when I try to
wake up the Duo I get a solid screen of horizontal lines on
the screen   it freezes 

I also get the high pitched hiss occasionally   but only at
startup 

I ve called the apple hotline      SOS APPL  three times
already and finally they agreed something is astray after my
Duo s screen would go dim and the hard drive spun down by
itselft and put itself to sleep  This problem only occured
twice  Apple sent me a box to ship my Duo to be looked at in
New York but the problem now is intermittent and I can t
afford to be without my Duo at this time 

Anyone out there with these same problems
