 I should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say  Muslim    In
 general  anyone who calls themselves a  Muslim  and does not do or 
 outwardly profess
 something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam
 is considered to be a Muslim   Thus  one who might do things contrary to
 Islam  through ignorance  for example  does not suddenly  not  become a
 Muslim   If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential
 principles  though  then one does leave Islam 

	You and Mr  bobby really need to sit down and decide what
exactly Islam   is  before posting here 

	According to  Zlumber  one is NOT a muslim when one is doing evil  
  A muslin can do no evil   According to him  one who does evil is suffering 
from  temporary athiesm  

	Now  would the members who claim to be  Muslims  get their stories 
straight    

  


        Satan and the Angels do not have freewill   
        They do what god tells them to do
