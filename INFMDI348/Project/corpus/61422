 kc  But back to the contest goals  there was a recent article in AW ST
about a
 kc  low cost  it s all relative     manned return to the moon   A General
 kc  Dynamics scheme involving a Titan IV   Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper
 kc  stage  LEV  and crew capsule   The mission consists of delivering two
 kc  unmanned payloads to the lunar surface  followed by a manned mission 
 kc  Total cost   US was         billion   Joint ESA    NASA project was
     
 kc  billion for the US share 

 kc  moon for a year    Hmmm   Not really practical   Anyone got a
 kc  cheaper better way of delivering       tonnes to the lunar surface
within
 kc  the decade   Anyone have a more precise guess about how much a year s
 kc  supply of consumables and equipment would weigh 

Why not modify the GD plan into Zurbrin s Compact Moon Direct scheme  let
one of those early flight carry an O  plant and make your own
