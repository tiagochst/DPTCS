From time to time I have made reference to a book called  The Two Babylons 
which is a book written by Alexander Hislop  mid      s  about the Babylonian
mystery religion and its flight through history   I was unable to put it down
the first time I read it  but others have found it dry   It has numberable
references and illustrations   If you are interested in purchasing your own
copy  you can call Moody Book Store                 and order it for        and
they will ship it to you    
  It is a good book just to get the reference titles for your own digs into the
mystery religions   I have found it invaluable for that purpose alone   But for
those who only want to skim the subject  it comes highly recommended   
  Just a note to my RC brothers and sisters   You may find this to be a
diatribe or you may find it to be a test to the origin and true nature of the
origin of RCism   If you are offended by anything that asks hard questions
about your denomination  as to whether or not it is  Christian   then perhaps
you should just passover this offer   To those who are a little more
adventurous  go for it and later  please contact me with you reasons pro or con
on the scholorship of this book   I really would be interested
