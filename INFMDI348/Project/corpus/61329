   Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex military 
   establishment  focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection 
   of spacecraft and which has participated in the development of 
   the Buran shuttle system   They are located near the NPO Energia 
   facility in Kaliningrad  outside of Moscow  
 
 If this facility is in Kaliningrad  this is not near Moscow 

Correction  and some more info  The Kaliningrad that Mr  Larrison
writes about is indeed near Moscow  I ve read that it may also be known by
the name Podlipk  and is a short distance from Zvezdny Gorodok  Star 
City  and the Cosmonaut Training Center there  I read that the Tsniimach
 Central Scientific Research Institute of Machine Building  est        
Enterprise was also responsible for creating the NKIK  Ground Command and 
Measurement Complex  including the Kaliningrad Flight Control Center
which has controlled all Soviet Russian manned spaceflights since its
completion in       However  it appears to have been a part of the 
Ministry of General Machine Building which was not part of the military
 Ministry of Defense  but would have been a part of the military industrial
complex
