 I am taking a course entitled  Exploring Science Using Internet  
 For our final project  we are to find a compendium of Internet resources 
 dealing with a science related topic  I chose Astronomy  Anyway  I was 
 wondering if anyone out there knew of any interesting resources on Internet
 that provide information on Astronomy  space  NASA  or anything like that 
 

One of the sci space FAQ postings deal with this   It s archived
somewhere   Perhaps someone can post where it is  I don 
remember
