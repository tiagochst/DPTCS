 On a side note  has anyone ever had a Mac Plus  smoke out  on them   We  
 have had four machines that all of a sudden start emitting a thick grayish  
 white smoke   In each case it was a capacitor that had gone bad   Has  
 anyone else encountered this

We ve had it happen a time or two   Beginning students think it is pretty
entertaining when it happens during a lab lecture or demonstration
