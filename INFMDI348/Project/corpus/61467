     If that s the case  let me point out that interstellar dust and 
  molecules provide many instances of things that are  well  not too far
  from being blackbodies   Many different observations  including IRAS
  and COBE  have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures
  can range from   K to    K 

Interstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies   The  large 
grains have sizes of order     micron and absorb visible light with
fair efficiency   However  at temperatures below     K      of the
thermal emission will be beyond    microns  where radiating
efficiency is poor    A small antenna cannot easily radiate at long
wavelengths    Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate
the energy they have absorbed 

Moreover  the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of    
microns   Grains colder than    K will radiate primarily at longer
wavelengths  and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them   In
the extreme limit  grains as cold as   K will be almost undetectable
by any conceivable observation 

Worse still  IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a
population of  small  grains   These grains have only perhaps   
atoms  and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to
temperatures of several hundred or      K   Of course they cool
quickly and then stay cold for a while  but  when they are radiating 
the characteristic temperature is several hundred K   Even a small
population of these grains can dramatically raise the observed
 average  temperature 

A model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has
three components   These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal
dust  color temperature      K   thermal emission from Zodiacal dust
 Tc       K   and thermal emission from Galactic dust  Tc    K    At
the ecliptic poles  the emissivities or dilution factors are
respectively    E      E    and  E     The first two are roughly
doubled in the ecliptic plane 

To find the thermal equilibrium temperature  we add up the dilution
factor times the fourth power of temperature for all components  then
take the fourth root   In the table below  starlight comes from
Allen s number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent
to     zero mag stars with B V color of        No doubt careful work
could do much better    The person who suggested starlight had a
dilution factor of E   must have been remembering wrong   We would be
cooked if that were the case   In any event  the energy density of
starlight comes out about the same as that of the microwave
background  and I believe that to be correct  

                         Dilution   Temp    DT  
Microwave background                            
Galactic dust               E                   
Zodiacal dust  emission     E                   
Zodiacal dust  scattering   E                   
Starlight                   E                   
                                                
                                                

The fourth root of     is     K   Outside the Solar system  the
result would be     K   

I find these results surprising  especially the importance of
Zodiacal dust  but I don t see any serious mistakes
