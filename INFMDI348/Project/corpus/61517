 How different would the contamination threat of a small manuevering tug
 be from that of the Shuttle and it s OMS engines      

The aperture door will be shut during reboost  Using the shuttle
means that there will be someone nearby to pry the door open again 
if it should stick 



 I just figured  if GOldin wants to really   prove out faster  cheaper
 better    have some of the whiz kids  slap together an expendable
 space manuevering tug  out of a BUs    and use that for the re boost 

It s clear that the  whiz kids  are not running the show  In any
case it s not prudent to stick a  slapped together  explosive device
on the end of a billion dollar asset that you d like to see again 
 Wiseacres might say that a shuttle is a slapped together explosive
device  but at least it s had some testing
