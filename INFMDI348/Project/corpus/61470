We are interested in constructing a reentry vehicle to be deployed from a
tether attached to an orbiting platform   This will be a follow on to our
succesful deployment of a    kilometer tether on the March    flight of
SEDS  Small Expendable Deployment System   which released an instrumented
payload that reentered the earth s atmosphere and burned up over the west
coast of Mexico   This time we want to make a payload that can be recovered 
We want to build it from  off the shelf  technology so as to do this as
quickly and inexpensively as possible   We want to be able to track the
payload after it has deployed its parachute   An idea we have is to put the
same kind of radio beacon on it that is used with SARSATs  Search and Rescue
Satellites    It would turn on with the opening of the parachute and aid in
tracking   These beacons are known in the marine industry as EPIRBs
 Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon    They are rugged  they have to
be to survive a ship wreck   and cheap   We have several questions 

    What is the world authority regulating the use of SARSAT beacons   Are
there multiple authorites  i e  military and civilian 

    What are the regulations regarding the use of SARSAT signals   Can they
be used for one of a kind situations with a long lead time of warning the
relevant authorities  or are they strictly reserved for life threatening
emergencies 

    What is the coverage of SARSATS   Are they in LEO with only intermittant
coverage of a fixed position on the earth  or are they in geosynchronous
orbit 

    Is there an industry organization governing the use and manufacture of
these transponders
