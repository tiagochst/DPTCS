 I have a strong preference for editions that do  not  indent the beginning
 of each verse as if verses were paragraphs   The verse numbering is a
 relatively modern addition and should not be given undue prominence 
 

Does anyone know of an English language edition that does not show the
verse  or even chapter  numbers   I have always thought that such an
edition would be very useful   although hard to navigate around 

I have a Scots NT that doesn t show verse numbers  and it is great to
read  particularly longer narrative passages  but my Scots isn t quite
up to doing proper study from this edition   I tend to use it to get a
 feel  for a story  particularly in the gospels  and then use an
English edition to look for details

 The original NEB put verse numbers only in the margin   The
Jerusalem Bible does the same  though they put a dot to mark the
boundaries between verses      clh
