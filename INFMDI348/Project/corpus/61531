   No  the thing is designed to be retrievable  in a pinch   Indeed  this
   dictated a rather odd design for the solar arrays  since they had to be
   retractable as well as extendable   
  
  Why not design the solar arrays to be detachable   if the shuttle is going
  to retunr the HST   what bother are some arrays   
 
 They can be detached in an emergency   But expensive hardware is not thrown
 away casually  bearing in mind that nobody knew the design was defective  
 If the deployment crew had found some nasty flaw    the lid failing to open 
 for example    it would have been a bit embarrassing to have to throw the
 solar arrays away to get the thing back in the payload bay 


I guess it s  kind of an aesthetics argument 

I can see the solar arrays being expensive   and  there could be
contingencies where you would be throwing away brand new
solar cells    but  it seems so cheap compared toa shuttle
mission  i wouldn t think they would bother
