  This does not make sence   why would the  FG work but the  FGx not
  work   it is the
  same monitor without accucolor and digital controls   works fine at
      x    with
  SVGA   what s the deal    anyway you can get a SVGA     with    mm and
      x    
  for      at Damark   are you saing that it probably would work while a
       NEC won t 
The  FGx has a maximum horizontal scan rate of   KHz  so driving it
at      KHz to get      x     on the Mac is WAY BEYOND the tolerance            The  FG is spec ed at   KHz  so going      KHz is only      above
the minimally guaranteed figure 

I too doubt if the Damark monitor would sync to a Mac at      x                 Like most things  you get what you pay   That s the deal
