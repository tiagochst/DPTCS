Subject      to fix TRACKBALL
Lines    

The trackbal on my PB    no longer moves in the horizontal direction   When I
called the nearest Authorized Apple Service person I was told that it probably
needed replacing and that would cost me over        Ouch 
  Can anyone recommend a less expensive way to fix this problem   One strange
symptom of the problem is that when I take the ball out of the socket and shine
a light into the hole I can make the cursor move horizontally by moving the
wheel with my finger  it works fine that way but won t work if I turn off the
light   Any suggestions or comments
