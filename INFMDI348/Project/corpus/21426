What is the basis of the idea of hell being a place of eternal
suffering   If it is Biblical  please reference 

Here s my train of thought  If God is using the Earth to manufacture
heavenly beings  then it is logical that there would be a certain
yield  and a certain amount of waste   The yield goes to Heaven  and
the waste is burned  destroyed  in Hell   Why is it necessary to
punish the waste  rather than just destroy it 

Peace and joy
