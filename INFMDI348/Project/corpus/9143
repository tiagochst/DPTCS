 With my limited knowladge about the PC Geos  I came out with following 
 comparison 

                  PC Geos      Windows       OS      Unix X  
                                                            

    can run win
    programs        nop           yap         yap     nop
                                                        
                                                      Novell is at least
                                                      demoing windows apps
                                                      running under UNIXWare 


    can run unix    nop        I have not     nop     yap
                               heard of it
                                                
                                Try MKS      MKS  
                                           others  esp 
                                              EMX

Note here  the MKS toolkit  for DOS Windows   OS    gives you a good
suite of standard UNIX utilities   There are other similar systems from
other vendors as well   The EMX system for OS   gives you most of the
standard UNIX system calls for recompiling your UNIX programs under
OS     Not quite the same thing as actually running UNIX programs
directly in either case  but EMX makes OS   almost as compatible with
UNIX systems as many UNIX systems are with each other   And  best of
all  EMX is free      

There is a similar system  GO    for DOS  but it doesn t work with
Windows  as far as I know 

    price                                             free      s
                                                      A good one
                                                      costs           
                                                      avaliable on Ext 
                                                      card too 

Should add in the cost for DOS with both Geos and Windows  neither of
which is a standalone OS at this point   Neither OS   nor UNIX requires
DOS 

BTW  two of the best unices I ve seen for the pee cee are UNIXWare      
for the personal edition  and LINUX  free    So I don t agree that  a
good one costs                 

And  if you really want to check out the various options available to
you  you should also look into DESQview and DESQview X
