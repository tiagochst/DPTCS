Undoubtedly people adopt atheism for many reasons  but I suspect that a biggie
is that the God they ve believed in is  in J B  Phillips s words   too small   
If a person s understanding of God is not allowed to grow and develop  it will
eventually become inadequate   The grey haired gentleman on a throne who was a
comforting image in childhood becomes a joke 

A therapist friend of mine sometimes suggests to her clients that they  fire
God    What she means by that is letting go of an inadequate understanding of
God to make room for a fuller one   But she follows up by encouraging them to
 hire a new one    My guess is that a lot of folks go through the firing
process  but are not adequately supported in the subsequent re hire
